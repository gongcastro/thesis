Some things are more easily talked about than done. Talking about *talking*---an activity sometimes referred to as *Linguistics*---is painfully difficult. Language is the most complex communicative system known, yet few people are surprised by the fact that infants pick it up so early in life, and so effortlessly. Some of those intrigued few people are developmentalists, whose scientific enterprise has kept a lucky bunch of them out of unemployment. For the last five years, I have been one of them. The present dissertation describes a tortuous learning adventure. Not by our infant participants---they are doing fine---but by me.

Language sparks the interest of many people quite easily. This was not my case. I failed *Spanish* more than once in high school. Whether my interest in language followed my academic performance or the other way around, I can't remember. I do remember taking the course Psychology of Language during my Bachelor in Psychology, and finding it fascinating. I am convinced that understanding language, not as an object to be dissected and observed, but as a living function that we somehow we get to enjoy, is what made it so attractive for me then. By the time I planned to pursue an academic carreer, I had other interests. I came to Barcelona to do a MSc in Neurosciences, and do research in spatial memory in rats. I was by pure chance that I got to come across an opportunity to do my MSc's dissertation about language acquisition, under the supervision of Prof. Sebastian-Galles. Five years later, I am writing this dissertation.

This project started  It has not been an easy road, despite all the facilities I have enjoyed.

 I did not get to grasp the mystery of language acquisition until later

Human language acquisition, and all of its complexity, can only be understood as the result of some interaction between a system that operates under computational limitations, over the rich information provided by available linguistic input. In their *Rethinking Innateness*, @elman1996rethinking illustrate this approach with using the following example, as described by @thomson1917growth:

> [...] honey cells start their lives as spherical objects. In the
hive these cells are packed together, each bee attempting to create as
much space as possible for itself within an individual cell. Viewed
along a plane, any single sphere can contact just six other spheres
[...]. When honey cells are packed together, the wax walls will undergo deformation. Furthermore, the surface tension between two honey cells acts to create a flat plane surface. Since each cell contacts just six other cells, the surface tension of the wax and the packing pressure of the bees will force each sphere into a hexagonal shape. The hexagonal shape maximizes the packing of
the hive space and the volume of each cell and offers the most economical use of the wax resource. Hence the labor of the bees and the forces of physics act in consortium to produce the hexagonal shape of the beehive. The bee doesn't need to "know" anything about hexagons. 

Complex patterns of results are widespread in language acquisition research. For instance, non-linearities are widespread in the observable outcomes of development. These observable learning outputs need not be the result of complex computations by the child. Advances in computation have shown how small, linear cumulative changes in a system can lead to complex, non-linear changes. Language acquisition reflects this. Neural networks show that some complex patterns observed in language acquisition can be explained in terms of simple computations on the speech input.

The present dissertation addresses the case of infants being raised hearing two languages. As most language acquisition researchers agree that studying bilingualism poses theoretical and methodological challenges that research in monolingual infants does not face. This increased complexity does not preclude the search for common mechanisms that both monolinguals and bilinguals exploit in their language acquisition journey, which sometimes result in divergent trajectories. Divergences between monolingual and bilingual language acquisition trajectories can be explained in terms of infants using common mechanisms to deal with a more complex input. The present dissertation addresses the case of bilinguals, as a lens to study language acquisition as a whole. In the same way bilingualism research build on findings in monolinguals, bilinguals can be studied as an opportunity to inform monolingual language acquisition research. Bilinguals represent a specific case of language acquisition in which infants require additional computations to than monolinguals.

In the present dissertation, we first discuss monolingual language acquisition, as a generally common ground with bilingual language acquisition. We then consider how a dual language exposure changes the conditions under which children acquire language. Finally, we delve into the domain of lexical acquisition and processing.

This thesis explores a small area of language acquisition research: how infants learn a specific type of linguistic unit called *words*, and whether bilingualism---the simultaneous acquisition of two language---impacts this process. Although some of the premises and claims expressed in the present work may apply to infants acquiring language though modalities other than the auditory, the scope of the present work is the developmental trajectories of hearing, typically developing infants. For this reason, most examples and arguments concern the auditory modality, and refer to events that are specifically relevant to hearing infants, like *sound*, *hearing*, *auditory*. We invite the reader to consider the case of deaf infants as a natural extension of the point made, whenever possible. For instance, note that we adopt a broad definition of *phonology* in which a phonological system is present, with the only difference to oral languages that the forms of the linguistic units is motor-visual.
