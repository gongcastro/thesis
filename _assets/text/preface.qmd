Talking about *talking*---an activity sometimes referred to as *Linguistics*---is painfully difficult. Language is the most complex communicative system known, yet few people are surprised by the fact that infants pick it up so early in life, and so effortlessly. Some of those intrigued few people are developmentalists, whose scientific enterprise has kept a lucky bunch of them out of unemployment. For the last five years, I have been one of them. In this dissertation, I present some of the contributions that have resulted from these years.

We addressed the case of bilingual infants or infants being raised in two languages. In particular, we investigated how such dual language exposure impacts the emerge of a mental lexicon, where phonological and conceptual representations find each other. We focused on the case of bilingual language acquisition as an extension of the monolingual case, which may provide insights about how language acquisition is shaped by different experiences with language.

It is known to the developmentalist that the trajectories of language acquisition of different infants may diverge substantially. Some of the sources of this individual variability have been identified and are under investigation. Cross-linguistic differences is one of them. Infants learning two different languages may follow slightly different paths towards language acquisition. This is also the case for bilingual infants. An influential monograph by @floccia2018introduction showed that the specific pair of languages that a bilingual child is learning affects their trajectories of vocabulary growth. In particular, they found that 24-month-old bilinguals were able to produce more words when their languages were lexically more similar (e.g., English-Dutch), compared to when both languages were lexically less similary (e.g., English-Mandarin). The motivation of this thesis is the investigation of the mechanisms underlying such facilitation effect of lexical similarity.

The first goal of this dissertation was to provide a mechanistic explanation to the effect found by @floccia2018introduction. We focused on the role of cognates (i.e., phonologically similar translation equivalents), as a type of word that could be learnt more easily by children. This would explain why participants in @floccia2018introduction who were learning lexically similar language (which share many cognates), had larger vocabulary sizes than those learning two languages with less lexical similarity (sharing fewer cognates). We first put forward the foundations of a model that involved the interaction between lexical frequency, quantitative language exposure, and cognateness, to generate a cognateness facilitation on word acquisition. We then designed a vocabulary questionnaire, the Barcelona Vocabulary Questionnaire (BVQ), which we used to collect vocabulary data from monolingual and bilingual participants living in the Metropolitan Area of Barcelona, who were learning Catalan and Spanish. We modelled comprehension and production estimates of a large sample of children to test plausibility of the mechanism hypothesised by our model of word acquisition. In the discussion of this dissertation, we elaborate further into the details of the model, which we refer to as the Accumulator Model of Bilingual Lexical Acquisition (AMBLA), and its implications for current understanding of bilingual lexical development.

A second goal of this dissertation was to test some of the assumptions behind the AMBLA model: that bilingual infants co-activate both languages during language exposure, even in monolingual situations. We collaborated with Prof. Kim Plunkett and Dr. Serene Siow in the design of an experimental task that would test the language non-selectivity of the developing bilingual lexicon. We collected data from a large cohort of monolinguals and bilinguals in both Oxford and Barcelona. Despite our efforts methological complications kept us from being able to address the hypotheses of interest. This was not the only pitfall we encounter during our research.

The COVID-19 was an important set back for the project. First, it severely limited our access to participants for the experimental task in both locations. First, universities were completely shut down during the lock down imposed by the governments in both Spain and United Kingdom, meaning that access to laboratories was not possible, even for researchers. During these times, only online data collection could be conducted. Second, it became challenging to find participants, even after the lockdown was lifted. This was especially the case in Oxford, were bilingual participants were already hard to find. Despite this, some families, to which we are very grateful, offered to us their time and interest, and took part in the testing sessions once the universities opened and the appropriate protocols were established.

The timings and the aims of the project had to be adjusted to the circumstances. For instance, due to the tight schedule that we were left after the lockdown, we decided to resume data collection in both laboratories in parallel. Initially, we planned to first conclude data collection in Oxford, were the original studies from which we adapted the experimental task were run. This would allow us to attempt to replicate these findings in the same population of monolinguals, before moving to monolingual and bilingual infants. Unfortunately, we were unable to replicate the original findings, keeping us from drawing conclusions about our predictions in the experimental section of the present dissertation.

The drawbacks encountered in the preparation of this dissertation were unfortunate, but also a good opportunity to learn from.
