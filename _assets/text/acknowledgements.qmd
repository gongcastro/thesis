I am not the first to investigate language acquisition. Many have preceeded me, and I hope many will follow---unfortunately, the present thesis has not solved language acquisition, the reader may be surprised to learn before even getting to the introductory chapter. Though, I believe I have been one of the most privileged to do so. My privileges have taken the shape of people, and I want to spend some lines to make them part of this book. 

Aquest camí comença amb la Prof. Núria Sebastian-Galles. Vaig coneixer a la Núria durant el segon semestre de 2018, quan feia el Màster en Neurociències a la Universitat de Barcelona. Núria em va acollir al seu grup, que es convertirà a casa meva en el darrers anys. Núria va confiar en mi per i em va donar un suport, tant academic com administratiu que molt poques personas han pogut aprofitar. Per moltes raons, pero sobre tot per reduir el numero de connectius utilitzats en aquesta tesis a la meitat, estare eternament agradiu.

I want to thank Prof. Kim Plunkett for his time and support during the realization of this dissertation. To Serene Siow, for being the good colleague she has been. To Irina Lepadatu and Nicola Guillen for their help collecting and analysing the data.

I walked this road in very good company, I will mention you from shortest to tallest until I fail to remember who is tallest than whom.

To Ege, who I have laughed, cried, drank, and sometimes worked with, and has made my life nothing but better in the last years. My self steem has been resilient to academia since you---the smartest person I know---unironically asked me which part of the egg was the yolk, and which was the *white*. For that I will be forever grateful. Cok tesekur ederim, gercekten.

To Chiara, academic big sister, and mentor. I hope I can keep learning and looking up to you the way I have since I was your master student. 

To Konstantina, the fastest learner I know, and also a great researcher that I am so proud to call my friend.

From here on I don't remember your heights, there order is now arbitrary.

To Devin, Alice, Farhad, Carlota, Indre, Dimitris, Bernat, Ane. I have collected very good memories during these times, even during the hardest moments. You happen to be behind most of them. I hope we can make make more of them soon.

To the SAP group, the ones now and the ones gone. For the conferences, the food, the talks, the discussions, the food, the support, the food, and the food.

To Ane, Dani, Manel, Marc, David, Ludo, for the good times in the office: the food, the laughs, the noise, the drinks, the silence that coexisted with the lines written in this thesis. Special mention to David's pecan pie, which still haunts my expectations of ever cooking a better one.

A Xavi, Sílvia, Katia, Cristina. M'aveu donat un suport invaluable. Sou la gent mes important del CBC.

A Nacho, Cris, Ali, Sol e Irene, y las muchas personas que he conocido gracias a Twitter. Os conocí en uno de los momentos m'as dificiles de esta estapa, y me habis recordado que hay gente buena en todas partes. Nos vemos pronto.

A Javi, Tesa, Marta e Inés. Saber que estábais conmigo, aunque fuera unos pocos dias al año, ha sido mi mayor provilegio estos años, y siempre lo sera.

A mi familia. No hay un solo día en el que no me haya sentido sino querido y apoyado.
