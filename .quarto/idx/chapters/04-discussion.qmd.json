We explored the role of cross-language lexical similarity on word acquisition, and its possible impact on the dynamics of lexical access. In this concluding chapter, we summarise the results from @sec-chapter2 and @sec-chapter3. We then elaborate on the implications of our findings on theoretical, and comment on some of the methodological limitations encountered. We also discuss possible steps to take in future research. We conclude highlighting the main contributions of the thesis.\n\n\n\nIn @sec-chapter2, we investigated how cognateness affects word acquisition in 10-to-32 month-old bilinguals learning Catalan and Spanish. We used Item Response Theory (IRT) to model the acquisition trajectories of a large sample of Catalan and Spanish words, and found a facilitation effect of cognateness on the probability of comprehension and production. This facilitation was mediated by an *ad hoc* index of word exposure, which adjusted the lexical frequency of the words for the dual linguistic input of bilinguals. Low-exposure words benefited more strongly from their cognate status, whereas words with average or high exposure were unaffected by their cognate status. We interpreted these results as evidence in favour of language non-selectivity playing a central role the initial lexicon. In particular, we suggested that exposure instances to words in one language contributed, to some extent as exposure instances to their translation equivalents (TEs).\n\nOur account for the results found in @sec-chapter2 built on the assumption that bilingual infants co-activate the TEs in both languages, even during monolingual situations, in which they hear words in exclusively one of the languages. Previous experimental work on language non-selectivity in the initial lexicon relied on paradigms in which participants are presented with words from the two languages during the same testing session, introducing them into a bilingual context [@vonholzen2012language; @floccia2020translation; @jardak2019labels; @singh2014one]. To our knowledge, no previous study had tested whether language non-selectivity takes place in fully monolingual paradigms. We addressed this gap in the literature in @sec-chapter3. We tested language non-selectivity in infants using an implicit naming paradigm, adapted from Mani and Plunkett [-@mani2010infant; -@mani2011phonological]. Participants were presented with an exclusively monolingual task. By manipulating the cognate status of prime words, and its impact on subsequent recognition of phonologically related words, we aimed to test whether participants co-activated TEs in both languages in monolingual situations. Methodological caveats in the adaptation of the task prevented us from draw conclusions from this experiment.\n\n## Towards a model of bilingual vocabulary growth\n\nDifferences in the developmental trajectories of word acquisition across bilingual populations have gained some attention in last decade. It had been previously established that, on average, bilingual infants learn words at a similar rate as monolinguals, despite facing a more challenging word-learning task [@pearson1993lexical; @pearson1994patterns; @poulin-dubois2013lexical; @core2013total; @byers-heinlein2023sometimes; @bosch2014first]. An influential monograph by @floccia2018introduction provided evidence for a possible mechanism behind bilingual word acquisition: bilingual toddlers learning two lexically similar languages (e.g., English-Dutch) show larger productive vocabularies than those learning two lexical, less similar languages (e.g., English-Mandarin). This suggested that some populations of bilinguals may exploit the similarities between their languages---particularly, the phonological similarity between TEs---to acquire words faster [see also @gampe2021does]. The authors pointed at the language non-selective hypothesis of lexical access as the mechanism behind this cross-language facilitation effect. How the dynamics of lexical access in the initial lexicon might relate to word acquisition was still to be addressed.\n\nIn @sec-chapter2, we explored the trajectories of acquisition of cognate and non-cognate words, and found an earlier age of the former---even after controlling for lexical frequency, relative language exposure, and word length---in line with previous findings by @mitchell2022cognates. This facilitation effect was stronger in words to which participants were exposed less often. These results converge with two main predictions from our proposal. First, the earlier age-of-acquisition for cognates than for non-cognates is in line with a faster accumulation of learning instances for cognates. This might be the result of cognate words receiving stronger co-activation from their TEs than non-cognates. We suggest that this might have been driven by cognates receiving additional activation in a higher degree than than non-cognates, because of their higher phonological similarity. The asymmetry in the size cognateness facilitation effect between high-exposure and low-exposure words provides further support for this explanation. Words with lower lexical frequency or belonging to participants' less dominant language (in which they receive less input) should benefit more strongly from the additional co-activation provided by their (more frequently activated) translation, than higher exposure words, which might receive such additional co-activation less frequently. This mechanism may explain the facilitative role of lexical similar reported by @floccia2018introduction, and the asymmetry found in the size of such effect between the English vocabulary and the additional-language vocabulary in their participants. Since English was the dominant language for most participants in their sample, it is possible that the increment in vocabulary size drive by cognates was stronger in the additional language, leading to a larger facilitation effect of lexical similarity. In summary, these results have important consequences for current models of bilingual lexical acquisition.\n\nThe present theoretical account makes an important contribution to the research on the bilingual lexicon. Few models of the bilingual lexicon have addressed the issue of early lexical acquisition. Instead, previous modelling efforts have mostly focused on word comprehension and production in the adult lexicon. Notable exemplars of models of the adult lexicon are the Revised Hierarchical Model (RHM) [@kroll1994category], the Bilingual Interactive Activation (BIA) model and its revised successor BIA+ [@dijkstra2002architecture; @dijkstra2013bia], BIMOLA [@grosjean1988exploring; @lewy2008lewy], SOMBIT [@li2002selforganizing; @li2004early], and BLINCS [@shook2013bilingual]. The more recent proposal of the Multilink model [@dijkstra2019multilink] integrates features of the RMH and BIA/BIA+ models to simulate a wide range of experimental observations in bilingual adults, spanning from the cognate facilitation effect in word recognition and production, as well as word translation. These models have provided valuable insight into the structure of the bilingual lexicon, and the underlying dynamics of word recognition and production, but have paid little attention to the developmental dimension of lexical acquisition. Other contributions, like the Ontogenic Model [@bordag2022ontogenesis; @gor2021fuzzy], BIA-d [a more development-oriented extension of the BIA/BIA+ model, @grainger2010rethinking], have delved into the emergence and consolidation of lexical representations during second language acquisition, still through the lens of the adult lexicon. In summary, few studies have addressed the early bilingual lexicon.\n\nOne exception is the DevLex-II model by @zhao2007bilingual, a bilingual extension of DevLex [@li2007dynamic] focused on monolingual lexical development. This connectionist model describes how lexical representations emerge during the simultaneous acquisition of two languages, and how phonological similarity shapes the structure of the resulting lexicon. DevLex-II successfully generates plausible patterns of lexical growth. For instance TEs are mapped together in the simulations of this model, suggesting that the acquisition of words in one language is sensitive to the acquisition of their translations in the other, in line with previous findings [@bilson2015semantic; @tsui2022are]. Simulations of word comprehension from DevLex-II also reveal within- and cross-language interference effect at the semantic and phonological levels, paralleling results in bilingual children: when the model was presented with a word, related semantic and phonological representations in both languages competed for selection [@zhao2013simulating]. The case of cognate words was not addressed in this model.\n\nIn @sec-chapter2, we presented a model of bilingual lexical acquisition. We also discussed its predictions, and underlying assumptions. In the following paragraphs, we present a first iteration into the formalisation of this model, which we have entitled as the Accumulator Model of Bilingual Lexical Acquisition (AMBLA). As its name indicates, AMBLA extends the notion of *accumulator* to the bilingual case, borrowed from accumulator models of language acquisition [@hidaka2013computational; @mollica2017how; @kachergis2022standard]. The central goal of AMBLA is to explain the two predictions tested in @sec-chapter2: that cognates are acquired earlier than non-cognates, and that this effect is stronger in the less-dominant language of the children. To explain how AMBLA works, we simulate the acquisition trajectories of two Catalan-Spanish TEs by a bilingual child learning Catalan and Spanish. The first TE is a cognate (/\\textipa{'gat}/--/\\textipa{\"ga.to}/ [cat]), and the second is a non-cognate (/\\textipa{\"gos}/--/\\textipa{\"pe.ro\"}/). For illustration purposes, we assume a scenario in which the child is exposed 60% of the time to Catalan (dominant language), and 40% of the time to Spanish (non-dominant language).\n\nFor each word-form, AMBLA generates an estimated age-of-acquisition. This value indicates the age at which some fixed proportion of the children in the target population (generally 50%) have acquired a word [@goodman2008does; @frank2021variability, but see @pineiro2000lexical for a frequency-based approach], according to caregivers' reports of word acquisition [e.g., @fenson1994variability; @fenson2007macarthurbates], or the size of naming effects in word recognition paradigms [@marchman2002concurrent; @marchman2008speed]. In AMBLA, the age-of-acquisition is defined as the age at which the child has accumulated a critical number of learning instances with the word-form. In the following simulations, we set this threshold at 300. This value was calibrated so that the scale of the model can be compared to the observed data in @sec-chapter2.\n\nIn AMBLA, the rate at which a child ($i$) accumulates leaning instances with a word form ($j$) is a multiplicative function of four variables (See @eq-ambla). First, the child's age ($\\text{Age}_i$): the older the child, the more learning instances they accumulate with the word-form. for interpretability, we expressed the child's age in months in the simulation below. A second variable is the lexical frequency of the word-form ($\\text{Frequency}_j$): the child will accumulate learning instances with more frequent words faster than with less frequent words. We assume that lexical frequency is a valid indicator of the amount of times child is exposed to a given word-form per unit of time, and that each exposure contributes one word learning instance^[Not all learning instances may be effective, as the mere exposure to a word-form may not result in the accumulation of information about the word and its referent. For simplicity, in the presented simulations we assumed that each exposure contributes one learning instance.]. We operationalised lexical frequency as the amount of times a child may encounter a word-form in their speech input in the time span of a month. Given that this number of exposure instances may randomly vary from month to month, assumed a Poisson distribution to generate word exposure counts for each word-form in each month. For simplicity, we assume identical lexical frequency for all word-forms by assigning the same parameters for the Poisson distribution ($\\lambda = 50$, which assumes that the child is most likely to encounter each word around 50 times per month).\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\textbf{AMBLA:}\\\\\n\\text{AoA}_{ij} &= \\{\\text{Age}_i \\mid y_{ij} = c\\}\\\\\ny_{ij} &= \\text{Age}_i \\cdot \\text{Frequency}_j \\cdot \\text{Exposure}_{ij} \\cdot \\text{Cognateness}_j\\\\\n\\text{Frequency}_j &\\sim \\text{Poisson}(\\lambda) \\\\\n\\text{Cognateness}_{j, j_{TE}} &= \\text{Levenshtein}(j, j_{TE}) \\\\\\\\\n\\text{Where:} \\\\\ni&: \\text{ child} \\\\\nj&: \\text{word-form} \\\\\nj_{TE}&: \\text{Translation equivalent of word-form } j\\\\\n\\text{AoA}_{ij}&: \\text{ Age-of-acquisition of word } j \\text{ for child } i\\\\\nc&: \\text{ Threshold number of learning instances for word acquisition} \\\\\ny_{ij}&: \\text{ Learning instances with word } j \\text{ accumulated by child } i\\\\\\\\\n\\text{For simulations}&: c = 300 \\text{, } \\lambda_j = 50 \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n$${#eq-ambla}\n\nThe third variable is the child's relative exposure to the language to which the word belongs to ($\\text{Exposure}_{ij}$): children will accumulate learning instances with words from their higher-exposure language faster than with words from their lower-exposure language. This variable takes values from 0 (the child does not receive any exposure to this language) to 1 (the child only receives exposure to this language). The child's degree of exposure to all languages must sum up to one. Finally, the fourth variable is the amount of phonological similarity between the two TEs ($\\text{Cognateness}_j$). This score ranges from 0 (no similarity) to 1 (identical cognates), and is calculated using the Levenshtein similarity, as in @sec-chapter2 (see @eq-lev).\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{Cognateness}(x, y) &= 1-\\frac{\\text{Levenshtein}(x, y)}{\\max{\\{i, j}\\}} \\\\\n\\text{Levenshtein}(x, y) &=  \n\\begin{cases}\n\\max(i, j) & \\text{, if} \\ \\min(i, j)=0\\\\\n\\min \\begin{cases}\n\\ \\text{Levenshtein}_{x, y}(i-1, j) + 1 \\\\\n\\ \\text{Levenshtein}_{x, y}(i, j-1) + 1 \\\\\n\\ \\text{Levenshtein}_{x, y}(i-1, j-1) + 1_{x_i \\neq y_j} \\\\\n\\end{cases}\n\\ &\\text{, otherwise}\n\\end{cases} \\\\\n\\text{Where:} \\\\\n&x, y: \\text{phonological transcriptions of the two word-forms}\\\\\n&i, j: \\text{word length (i.e., number of phonemes) of } x \\text{ and } y \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n$${#eq-lev}\n\n@fig-ambla illustrates the outcomes of 50 simulations of the AMBLA model for the two TEs. Overall, the accumulation of learning instances is faster for the Catalan word-forms than for the Spanish forms, leading to an earlier age-of-acquisition for the former. This is an anticipated outcome, as the child is more likely to encounter Catalan word-forms in their speech input, compared to Spanish word-forms (again, assuming that lexical frequency is constant for the Catalan and the Spanish word-forms). This difference in age-of-acquisition between Catalan and Spanish word-forms is attenuated by their cognate status. The AMBLA model assumes a cross-talk between word-forms in both languages, in such way that learning instances for word-forms in one language may count as well for their TEs, as the result of their co-activation during speech comprehension. For instance, the Spanish word-form /\\textipa{\"ga.to}/ benefits from the learning instances that its cognate translation /\\textipa{\"gat}/ receives (both word-forms share 0.75 Levenshtein similarity). The Spanish word-form /\\textipa{\"pe.ro}/ however, would benefit in a less degree from the learning instances accumulated by its non-cognate translation /\\textipa{\"gos}/, given their low phonological similarity (0.00). In the case of the cognate TE, the word-form in the language of lower exposure (Spanish) occurs at an earlier age than in the non-cognate TE, as the result of the language non-selective accumulation of learning instances across phonological links.\n\n\\newpage\n\n```{r fig-ambla}\n#| label: fig-ambla\n#| fig-cap: \"Simulations from AMBLA for the acquisition for two translation equivalents in Catalan and Spanish.

In the cognate TE, the word-form belonging to the language of lower exposure (Spanish) benefited from its cognate status more strongly than the Catalan word, which belonged to the language of higher exposure. These outcomes mirror the findings in @sec-chapter2, which provides converging evidence for the central mechanism of AMBLA: the cross-language accumulation of learning instances for cognate words. As previously explained, we hypothesis that the asymmetry in this effect is driven by the fact that word-forms from the higher-exposure language (which the child encounters more frequently) provide additional learning instances to their TEs than word-forms from the lower-exposure language (which the child encounters less frequently).\n\nThe simulations from AMBLA presented above correspond to a first interaction in the formalisation of the model. Future work will be addressed at refining and expanding its current implementation. The ultimate goal is to make AMBLA a useful model for generating and testing quantitative predictions of word age-of-acquisition [@kachergis2022standard], while keeping a minimal structure and ensuring the interpretability of its parameters [see @magnuson2020earshot for a similar approach on a minimal model of spoken word recognition]. More generally, we anticipate that a more principled formalisation of the inner workings of AMBLA may provide a stronger bridge between hypotheses about lexical development, and the statistical inference conducted on observations about word acquisition [@navarro2019devil; @guest2021how; @wills2017progress].\n\n## Methodological contributions\n\nA considerable part of the present dissertation has built on a database of vocabulary data collected from 2020 onwards. To gather this database, we designed and implemented an *ad hoc* questionnaire the Barcelona Vocabulary Questionnaire (BVQ) [@garcia-castro2023bvq]. This questionnaire was filled in by a large sample of families of monolinguals and bilinguals aged 10 to 32 months, learning Catalan and Spanish. Collected data included comprehension and production estimates for individual words in Catalan and Spanish. Queries to the database can be performed through its associated R package `bvq` ([https://gongcastro.github.io/bvq](https://gongcastro.github.io/bvq)), which provides a sizable amount of acquisition reports, and may be used to address further research questions about bilingual lexical development. In addition, this questionnaire was developed open source software, and all the materials and code used in process are available at the GitHub repository ([https://github.com/gongcastro/bvq](https://github.com/gongcastro/bvq)).\n\nAnother contribution of the present dissertation is the modelling approach adopted throughout @sec-chapter2 and @sec-chapter3. We highlight two features of interest. First, we adopted a Bayesian approach to parameter estimation and statistical inference. This approach provides great advantages, compared to the more widespread frequentist approach. Among them, we highlight the possibility to incorporate previous knowledge about the distribution of parameters of interest in a model, providing a more stable and efficient computation of the posterior coefficients. This proved to be a valuable asset in the implementation of complex multilevel structures for the random effects of the models, which we describe below. Some participants contributed partial data sets, in which for particular combinations of levels of the predictors of interested, few observations were gathered, if any. In these cases, a frequentist approach would most likely have provided unstable inferences, if not computational complications (e.g., convergence issues during the estimation of parameters). Following a Bayesian approach, we specified a weakly informative prior for the parameters in our models, so that incoming observations would gradually update the shape of the distribution of the parameters until data collection concluded. At no point the parameters of the models provided unfeasible estimates, as the distribution of their parameters was constrained by theoretically grounded prior distributions.\n\nIn @sec-chapter2, caregivers of many ---but not all of---participants provided answers about comprehension or production for the same words. Conversely, the same participant provided such responses to multiple---but not all of---words. To analyse this type of data sets, previous studies aggregated scores across items or participants, in order to avoid violations of the assumption of independence between the residuals of related observations (e.g., belonging to the same participant) [@floccia2018introduction; @bosch2014first]. As a consequence, information at participant-level or item-level was not available in subsequent analyses. On the contrary, in this dissertation we incorporated the complex data collection design into the structure of our model in the form of IRT, in which participants and words were included as crossed random effects in the random effects structure of the model. Data analysis in @sec-chapter3 also benefited from this approach, given its complex data collection design, in which some participants were tested more than once. In this case, we included participants and testing sessions as nested random effects. In summary, the present dissertation benefited from a Bayesian approach to statistical inference that may be of interest for future research in language acquisition.\n\n## Limitations and future research\n\nOne of the main pitfalls encountered in this dissertation was the experimental caveats in @sec-chapter2. Our adaptation of the original implicit naming task by Mani and Plunkett [-@mani2010infant; -@mani2011phonological] failed to reproduce the expected results. We introduced some adjustments to the structure of the trial, in order to maximise the probability of detecting cross-language priming effects. Such effects are short-lived and more difficult to detect than within language priming effects. For this reason, we removed the pre-naming phase of the trial, in which target and distractor pictures are presented prior to the auditory target label. This made the presentation of the prime picture and the target auditory label closer in time. We expected the immediacy of the presentation of both stimuli to increase of the size of the priming effect. Instead, this adjustment appeared to disrupt the lexical retrieval of the prime label, in such way that priming effects were not observed in any of the experimental conditions. This prevented us from drawing any conclusions about the presence of such effects in the initial lexicon from this experiment. Future research should address whether a longer inter-stimulus interval between the presentation of the prime and the target would lead to the observation of priming effects.\n\nThe present dissertation contributes several open questions. One of them is if the cognate facilitation effect reported in @sec-chapter2 is present in other populations of bilinguals, namely those learning more lexically dissimilar languages. As mentioned in the Discussion section of @sec-chapter2, Catalan and Spanish share many cognates. The large amount of cognates shared by Catalan and Spanish may increase infants' sensitivity to cross-linguistic phonological similarity during vocabulary acquisition leading to cognateness playing a more central role than in the case of infants who encounter fewer cognates in their linguistic input. For instance, infants learning English and Mandarin, two languages that share very few cognates, may not be able to exploit cross-language similarity to boost the acquisition of words in both languages during language exposure. The approach followed by @floccia2018introduction [see also @siow2023double; @floccia2020translation] of collecting data from infants learning a diverse pool of language pairs would be convenient for addressing this issue.\n\nThe evidence provided in @sec-chapter2 in favour of an earlier age-of-acquisition of cognates does not address the particular mechanisms infants may use to accumulate information about word-forms and their association to their corresponding referents. We used the term *learning instance* [@mollica2017how] to refer to exposures to a word in which infants *may* use to consolidate its lexical representation. Determining the specific condition under which a learning instance is effective (i.e., may lead to word learning) falls out of the scope of the present dissertation. We simply assume that some learning instances may be effective, and that the number of effective learning instance is a function of the total number of learning infants a child encounters on a daily basis. An experimental approach to word learning, in which the impact of cognateness is investigated, would provide valuable insights into the mechanisms behind the role of cross-linguistic similarity on word acquisition.\n\nFor instance, a recent study by @tsui2023patterns provides a potentially suitable paradigm to investigate the impact of cognateness on online word learning. The authors designed a word learning task in which they tested bilingual infants aged 3-to-5 years of age, learning French and English (in Montreal, Canada), and Spanish and English (in New Jersey, United States). In the learning phase, participants were trained to associate novel labels to novel objects. At test, participants were presented with pairs of objects encountered in the learning phase, and a label that corresponded to one of them. Participants were instructed to select the corresponding object in a touchscreen. Participants completed two blocks of training and test phases. In the training phase of one block, participants were presented with sentences labelling the novel objects in both languages in an interleaved fashion. For instance, in one trial they would be presented with a novel object, which would be labelled in English (e.g., *gasser* in English). In the next trial, they would be presented with the same object, which this time would be labelled in French (e.g., *donquete* in French, or *sasco* in Spanish). This condition simulated a *language mixing* environment (i.e., children are exposed to both languages in the same situations, encountering words from both languages interleaved in speech), to which a sizeable proportion of bilinguals are exposed [@byers-heinlein2013parental]. In the training phase of the other block, participants were presented with consecutive trials labelling the object in the same language, and then with consecutive trials labeling the object in the other language. This condition simulated a *one-language-at-a-time* environment. Overall, participants succeeded at learning the words in both conditions. This suggests that infants benefit equally from being exposed to labeling events in alternating languages in an interleaved fashion (a bilingual environment) and in an synchronous fashion (monolingual situations).\n\n@tsui2023patterns used phonologically distinct novel labels across languages. By extending this paradigm it could be possible to investigate whether participants learning of the label-referent associations is facilitated by the degree of phonological between the TEs. If participants co-activate newly learned TEs in both languages, word learning should be facilitation more strongly by the repetition of phonologically similar TEs (i.e., cognates) than from the repetition of phonologically dissimilar TEs (i.e., non-cognates). Another variable of interest for such experimental paradigm could be the lexical similarity between the two languages being acquired. The two populations of bilinguals in @tsui2023patterns, ones exposed to French and English, and the others to Spanish-English, were learning two languages belonging to two different typological families. At the lexical level both pairs of languages are relatively distant, compared to languages belonging to the same family, like Catalan and Spanish. By comparing how bilinguals process cognates in world learning contexts, depending on the overall lexical similarity of their languages (e.g., high in the case of Catalan and Spanish, low in the case of Euskera and Spanish), it could be possible to investigate how the linguistic input shapes the strategies followed by bilinguals during early lexical development. In summary, future steps may involve experimental paradigms to investigate the mechanisms involved in the cognate facilitation of word acquisition with more details, and with a finer control of the conditions in which participants are exposed to the word-forms.\n\n\n## Conclusions\n\nThe present dissertation provides insights into the developing bilingual lexicon. We provided evidence in favour of a mechanistic account of word acquisition, in which bilinguals exploit the language non-selectivity of their lexicon to facilitate the acquisition of cognate words. These findings have important consequences for the current understanding of bilingual vocabulary growth, and in particular, the mechanisms underlying the parallel trajectories of lexical acquisition of monolinguals and bilinguals.\n\n\\clearpage","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n```{r setup}\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(magick)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(here)\nlibrary(ggdist)\nlibrary(distributional)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidyr)\n\nsource(here(\"R\", \"ambla.R\"))\n\nclrs <- c(\"#ED1D3F\", \"#F47B8F\", \"#70B3FF\", \"#004CA3\", \"#002147\")\n```\nThe aim of the present thesis was to investigate the initial bilingual lexicon. We explored the role of cross-language lexical similarity on word acquisition, and its possible impact on the dynamics of lexical access. In this concluding chapter, we summarise the results from @sec-chapter2 and @sec-chapter3. We then elaborate on the implications of our findings on theoretical, and comment on some of the methodological limitations encountered. We also discuss possible steps to take in future research. We conclude highlighting the main contributions of the thesis.\n\n\n## Summary of results\n\nIn @sec-chapter2, we investigated how cognateness affects word acquisition in 10-to-32 month-old bilinguals learning Catalan and Spanish. We used Item Response Theory (IRT) to model the acquisition trajectories of a large sample of Catalan and Spanish words, and found a facilitation effect of cognateness on the probability of comprehension and production. This facilitation was mediated by an *ad hoc* index of word exposure, which adjusted the lexical frequency of the words for the dual linguistic input of bilinguals. Low-exposure words benefited more strongly from their cognate status, whereas words with average or high exposure were unaffected by their cognate status. We interpreted these results as evidence in favour of language non-selectivity playing a central role the initial lexicon. In particular, we suggested that exposure instances to words in one language contributed, to some extent as exposure instances to their translation equivalents (TEs).\n\nOur account for the results found in @sec-chapter2 built on the assumption that bilingual infants co-activate the TEs in both languages, even during monolingual situations, in which they hear words in exclusively one of the languages. Previous experimental work on language non-selectivity in the initial lexicon relied on paradigms in which participants are presented with words from the two languages during the same testing session, introducing them into a bilingual context [@vonholzen2012language; @floccia2020translation; @jardak2019labels; @singh2014one]. To our knowledge, no previous study had tested whether language non-selectivity takes place in fully monolingual paradigms. We addressed this gap in the literature in @sec-chapter3. We tested language non-selectivity in infants using an implicit naming paradigm, adapted from Mani and Plunkett [-@mani2010infant; -@mani2011phonological]. Participants were presented with an exclusively monolingual task. By manipulating the cognate status of prime words, and its impact on subsequent recognition of phonologically related words, we aimed to test whether participants co-activated TEs in both languages in monolingual situations. Methodological caveats in the adaptation of the task prevented us from draw conclusions from this experiment.\n\n## Towards a model of bilingual vocabulary growth\n\nDifferences in the developmental trajectories of word acquisition across bilingual populations have gained some attention in last decade. It had been previously established that, on average, bilingual infants learn words at a similar rate as monolinguals, despite facing a more challenging word-learning task [@pearson1993lexical; @pearson1994patterns; @poulin-dubois2013lexical; @core2013total; @byers-heinlein2023sometimes; @bosch2014first]. An influential monograph by @floccia2018introduction provided evidence for a possible mechanism behind bilingual word acquisition: bilingual toddlers learning two lexically similar languages (e.g., English-Dutch) show larger productive vocabularies than those learning two lexical, less similar languages (e.g., English-Mandarin). This suggested that some populations of bilinguals may exploit the similarities between their languages---particularly, the phonological similarity between TEs---to acquire words faster [see also @gampe2021does]. The authors pointed at the language non-selective hypothesis of lexical access as the mechanism behind this cross-language facilitation effect. How the dynamics of lexical access in the initial lexicon might relate to word acquisition was still to be addressed.\n\nIn @sec-chapter2, we explored the trajectories of acquisition of cognate and non-cognate words, and found an earlier age of the former---even after controlling for lexical frequency, relative language exposure, and word length---in line with previous findings by @mitchell2022cognates. This facilitation effect was stronger in words to which participants were exposed less often. These results converge with two main predictions from our proposal. First, the earlier age-of-acquisition for cognates than for non-cognates is in line with a faster accumulation of learning instances for cognates. This might be the result of cognate words receiving stronger co-activation from their TEs than non-cognates. We suggest that this might have been driven by cognates receiving additional activation in a higher degree than than non-cognates, because of their higher phonological similarity. The asymmetry in the size cognateness facilitation effect between high-exposure and low-exposure words provides further support for this explanation. Words with lower lexical frequency or belonging to participants' less dominant language (in which they receive less input) should benefit more strongly from the additional co-activation provided by their (more frequently activated) translation, than higher exposure words, which might receive such additional co-activation less frequently. This mechanism may explain the facilitative role of lexical similar reported by @floccia2018introduction, and the asymmetry found in the size of such effect between the English vocabulary and the additional-language vocabulary in their participants. Since English was the dominant language for most participants in their sample, it is possible that the increment in vocabulary size drive by cognates was stronger in the additional language, leading to a larger facilitation effect of lexical similarity. In summary, these results have important consequences for current models of bilingual lexical acquisition.\n\nThe present theoretical account makes an important contribution to the research on the bilingual lexicon. Few models of the bilingual lexicon have addressed the issue of early lexical acquisition. Instead, previous modelling efforts have mostly focused on word comprehension and production in the adult lexicon. Notable exemplars of models of the adult lexicon are the Revised Hierarchical Model (RHM) [@kroll1994category], the Bilingual Interactive Activation (BIA) model and its revised successor BIA+ [@dijkstra2002architecture; @dijkstra2013bia], BIMOLA [@grosjean1988exploring; @lewy2008lewy], SOMBIT [@li2002selforganizing; @li2004early], and BLINCS [@shook2013bilingual]. The more recent proposal of the Multilink model [@dijkstra2019multilink] integrates features of the RMH and BIA/BIA+ models to simulate a wide range of experimental observations in bilingual adults, spanning from the cognate facilitation effect in word recognition and production, as well as word translation. These models have provided valuable insight into the structure of the bilingual lexicon, and the underlying dynamics of word recognition and production, but have paid little attention to the developmental dimension of lexical acquisition. Other contributions, like the Ontogenic Model [@bordag2022ontogenesis; @gor2021fuzzy], BIA-d [a more development-oriented extension of the BIA/BIA+ model, @grainger2010rethinking], have delved into the emergence and consolidation of lexical representations during second language acquisition, still through the lens of the adult lexicon. In summary, few studies have addressed the early bilingual lexicon.\n\nOne exception is the DevLex-II model by @zhao2007bilingual, a bilingual extension of DevLex [@li2007dynamic] focused on monolingual lexical development. This connectionist model describes how lexical representations emerge during the simultaneous acquisition of two languages, and how phonological similarity shapes the structure of the resulting lexicon. DevLex-II successfully generates plausible patterns of lexical growth. For instance TEs are mapped together in the simulations of this model, suggesting that the acquisition of words in one language is sensitive to the acquisition of their translations in the other, in line with previous findings [@bilson2015semantic; @tsui2022are]. Simulations of word comprehension from DevLex-II also reveal within- and cross-language interference effect at the semantic and phonological levels, paralleling results in bilingual children: when the model was presented with a word, related semantic and phonological representations in both languages competed for selection [@zhao2013simulating]. The case of cognate words was not addressed in this model.\n\nIn @sec-chapter2, we presented a model of bilingual lexical acquisition. We also discussed its predictions, and underlying assumptions. In the following paragraphs, we present a first iteration into the formalisation of this model, which we have entitled as the Accumulator Model of Bilingual Lexical Acquisition (AMBLA). As its name indicates, AMBLA extends the notion of *accumulator* to the bilingual case, borrowed from accumulator models of language acquisition [@hidaka2013computational; @mollica2017how; @kachergis2022standard]. The central goal of AMBLA is to explain the two predictions tested in @sec-chapter2: that cognates are acquired earlier than non-cognates, and that this effect is stronger in the less-dominant language of the children. To explain how AMBLA works, we simulate the acquisition trajectories of two Catalan-Spanish TEs by a bilingual child learning Catalan and Spanish. The first TE is a cognate (/\\textipa{'gat}/--/\\textipa{\"ga.to}/ [cat]), and the second is a non-cognate (/\\textipa{\"gos}/--/\\textipa{\"pe.ro\"}/). For illustration purposes, we assume a scenario in which the child is exposed 60% of the time to Catalan (dominant language), and 40% of the time to Spanish (non-dominant language).\n\nFor each word-form, AMBLA generates an estimated age-of-acquisition. This value indicates the age at which some fixed proportion of the children in the target population (generally 50%) have acquired a word [@goodman2008does; @frank2021variability, but see @pineiro2000lexical for a frequency-based approach], according to caregivers' reports of word acquisition [e.g., @fenson1994variability; @fenson2007macarthurbates], or the size of naming effects in word recognition paradigms [@marchman2002concurrent; @marchman2008speed]. In AMBLA, the age-of-acquisition is defined as the age at which the child has accumulated a critical number of learning instances with the word-form. In the following simulations, we set this threshold at 300. This value was calibrated so that the scale of the model can be compared to the observed data in @sec-chapter2.\n\nIn AMBLA, the rate at which a child ($i$) accumulates leaning instances with a word form ($j$) is a multiplicative function of four variables (See @eq-ambla). First, the child's age ($\\text{Age}_i$): the older the child, the more learning instances they accumulate with the word-form. for interpretability, we expressed the child's age in months in the simulation below. A second variable is the lexical frequency of the word-form ($\\text{Frequency}_j$): the child will accumulate learning instances with more frequent words faster than with less frequent words. We assume that lexical frequency is a valid indicator of the amount of times child is exposed to a given word-form per unit of time, and that each exposure contributes one word learning instance^[Not all learning instances may be effective, as the mere exposure to a word-form may not result in the accumulation of information about the word and its referent. For simplicity, in the presented simulations we assumed that each exposure contributes one learning instance.]. We operationalised lexical frequency as the amount of times a child may encounter a word-form in their speech input in the time span of a month. Given that this number of exposure instances may randomly vary from month to month, assumed a Poisson distribution to generate word exposure counts for each word-form in each month. For simplicity, we assume identical lexical frequency for all word-forms by assigning the same parameters for the Poisson distribution ($\\lambda = 50$, which assumes that the child is most likely to encounter each word around 50 times per month).\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\textbf{AMBLA:}\\\\\n\\text{AoA}_{ij} &= \\{\\text{Age}_i \\mid y_{ij} = c\\}\\\\\ny_{ij} &= \\text{Age}_i \\cdot \\text{Frequency}_j \\cdot \\text{Exposure}_{ij} \\cdot \\text{Cognateness}_j\\\\\n\\text{Frequency}_j &\\sim \\text{Poisson}(\\lambda) \\\\\n\\text{Cognateness}_{j, j_{TE}} &= \\text{Levenshtein}(j, j_{TE}) \\\\\\\\\n\\text{Where:} \\\\\ni&: \\text{ child} \\\\\nj&: \\text{word-form} \\\\\nj_{TE}&: \\text{Translation equivalent of word-form } j\\\\\n\\text{AoA}_{ij}&: \\text{ Age-of-acquisition of word } j \\text{ for child } i\\\\\nc&: \\text{ Threshold number of learning instances for word acquisition} \\\\\ny_{ij}&: \\text{ Learning instances with word } j \\text{ accumulated by child } i\\\\\\\\\n\\text{For simulations}&: c = 300 \\text{, } \\lambda_j = 50 \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n$${#eq-ambla}\n\nThe third variable is the child's relative exposure to the language to which the word belongs to ($\\text{Exposure}_{ij}$): children will accumulate learning instances with words from their higher-exposure language faster than with words from their lower-exposure language. This variable takes values from 0 (the child does not receive any exposure to this language) to 1 (the child only receives exposure to this language). The child's degree of exposure to all languages must sum up to one. Finally, the fourth variable is the amount of phonological similarity between the two TEs ($\\text{Cognateness}_j$). This score ranges from 0 (no similarity) to 1 (identical cognates), and is calculated using the Levenshtein similarity, as in @sec-chapter2 (see @eq-lev).\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{Cognateness}(x, y) &= 1-\\frac{\\text{Levenshtein}(x, y)}{\\max{\\{i, j}\\}} \\\\\n\\text{Levenshtein}(x, y) &=  \n\\begin{cases}\n\\max(i, j) & \\text{, if} \\ \\min(i, j)=0\\\\\n\\min \\begin{cases}\n\\ \\text{Levenshtein}_{x, y}(i-1, j) + 1 \\\\\n\\ \\text{Levenshtein}_{x, y}(i, j-1) + 1 \\\\\n\\ \\text{Levenshtein}_{x, y}(i-1, j-1) + 1_{x_i \\neq y_j} \\\\\n\\end{cases}\n\\ &\\text{, otherwise}\n\\end{cases} \\\\\n\\text{Where:} \\\\\n&x, y: \\text{phonological transcriptions of the two word-forms}\\\\\n&i, j: \\text{word length (i.e., number of phonemes) of } x \\text{ and } y \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n$${#eq-lev}\n\n@fig-ambla illustrates the outcomes of 50 simulations of the AMBLA model for the two TEs. Overall, the accumulation of learning instances is faster for the Catalan word-forms than for the Spanish forms, leading to an earlier age-of-acquisition for the former. This is an anticipated outcome, as the child is more likely to encounter Catalan word-forms in their speech input, compared to Spanish word-forms (again, assuming that lexical frequency is constant for the Catalan and the Spanish word-forms). This difference in age-of-acquisition between Catalan and Spanish word-forms is attenuated by their cognate status. The AMBLA model assumes a cross-talk between word-forms in both languages, in such way that learning instances for word-forms in one language may count as well for their TEs, as the result of their co-activation during speech comprehension. For instance, the Spanish word-form /\\textipa{\"ga.to}/ benefits from the learning instances that its cognate translation /\\textipa{\"gat}/ receives (both word-forms share 0.75 Levenshtein similarity). The Spanish word-form /\\textipa{\"pe.ro}/ however, would benefit in a less degree from the learning instances accumulated by its non-cognate translation /\\textipa{\"gos}/, given their low phonological similarity (0.00). In the case of the cognate TE, the word-form in the language of lower exposure (Spanish) occurs at an earlier age than in the non-cognate TE, as the result of the language non-selective accumulation of learning instances across phonological links.\n\n\\newpage\n\n```{r fig-ambla}\n#| label: fig-ambla\n#| fig-cap: \"Simulations from AMBLA for the acquisition for two translation equivalents in Catalan and Spanish.

In the cognate TE, the word-form belonging to the language of lower exposure (Spanish) benefited from its cognate status more strongly than the Catalan word, which belonged to the language of higher exposure. These outcomes mirror the findings in @sec-chapter2, which provides converging evidence for the central mechanism of AMBLA: the cross-language accumulation of learning instances for cognate words. As previously explained, we hypothesis that the asymmetry in this effect is driven by the fact that word-forms from the higher-exposure language (which the child encounters more frequently) provide additional learning instances to their TEs than word-forms from the lower-exposure language (which the child encounters less frequently).\n\nThe simulations from AMBLA presented above correspond to a first interaction in the formalisation of the model. Future work will be addressed at refining and expanding its current implementation. The ultimate goal is to make AMBLA a useful model for generating and testing quantitative predictions of word age-of-acquisition [@kachergis2022standard], while keeping a minimal structure and ensuring the interpretability of its parameters [see @magnuson2020earshot for a similar approach on a minimal model of spoken word recognition]. More generally, we anticipate that a more principled formalisation of the inner workings of AMBLA may provide a stronger bridge between hypotheses about lexical development, and the statistical inference conducted on observations about word acquisition [@navarro2019devil; @guest2021how; @wills2017progress].\n\n## Methodological contributions\n\nA considerable part of the present dissertation has built on a database of vocabulary data collected from 2020 onwards. To gather this database, we designed and implemented an *ad hoc* questionnaire the Barcelona Vocabulary Questionnaire (BVQ) [@garcia-castro2023bvq]. This questionnaire was filled in by a large sample of families of monolinguals and bilinguals aged 10 to 32 months, learning Catalan and Spanish. Collected data included comprehension and production estimates for individual words in Catalan and Spanish. Queries to the database can be performed through its associated R package `bvq` ([https://gongcastro.github.io/bvq](https://gongcastro.github.io/bvq)), which provides a sizable amount of acquisition reports, and may be used to address further research questions about bilingual lexical development. In addition, this questionnaire was developed open source software, and all the materials and code used in process are available at the GitHub repository ([https://github.com/gongcastro/bvq](https://github.com/gongcastro/bvq)).\n\nAnother contribution of the present dissertation is the modelling approach adopted throughout @sec-chapter2 and @sec-chapter3. We highlight two features of interest. First, we adopted a Bayesian approach to parameter estimation and statistical inference. This approach provides great advantages, compared to the more widespread frequentist approach. Among them, we highlight the possibility to incorporate previous knowledge about the distribution of parameters of interest in a model, providing a more stable and efficient computation of the posterior coefficients. This proved to be a valuable asset in the implementation of complex multilevel structures for the random effects of the models, which we describe below. Some participants contributed partial data sets, in which for particular combinations of levels of the predictors of interested, few observations were gathered, if any. In these cases, a frequentist approach would most likely have provided unstable inferences, if not computational complications (e.g., convergence issues during the estimation of parameters). Following a Bayesian approach, we specified a weakly informative prior for the parameters in our models, so that incoming observations would gradually update the shape of the distribution of the parameters until data collection concluded. At no point the parameters of the models provided unfeasible estimates, as the distribution of their parameters was constrained by theoretically grounded prior distributions.\n\nIn @sec-chapter2, caregivers of many ---but not all of---participants provided answers about comprehension or production for the same words. Conversely, the same participant provided such responses to multiple---but not all of---words. To analyse this type of data sets, previous studies aggregated scores across items or participants, in order to avoid violations of the assumption of independence between the residuals of related observations (e.g., belonging to the same participant) [@floccia2018introduction; @bosch2014first]. As a consequence, information at participant-level or item-level was not available in subsequent analyses. On the contrary, in this dissertation we incorporated the complex data collection design into the structure of our model in the form of IRT, in which participants and words were included as crossed random effects in the random effects structure of the model. Data analysis in @sec-chapter3 also benefited from this approach, given its complex data collection design, in which some participants were tested more than once. In this case, we included participants and testing sessions as nested random effects. In summary, the present dissertation benefited from a Bayesian approach to statistical inference that may be of interest for future research in language acquisition.\n\n## Limitations and future research\n\nOne of the main pitfalls encountered in this dissertation was the experimental caveats in @sec-chapter2. Our adaptation of the original implicit naming task by Mani and Plunkett [-@mani2010infant; -@mani2011phonological] failed to reproduce the expected results. We introduced some adjustments to the structure of the trial, in order to maximise the probability of detecting cross-language priming effects. Such effects are short-lived and more difficult to detect than within language priming effects. For this reason, we removed the pre-naming phase of the trial, in which target and distractor pictures are presented prior to the auditory target label. This made the presentation of the prime picture and the target auditory label closer in time. We expected the immediacy of the presentation of both stimuli to increase of the size of the priming effect. Instead, this adjustment appeared to disrupt the lexical retrieval of the prime label, in such way that priming effects were not observed in any of the experimental conditions. This prevented us from drawing any conclusions about the presence of such effects in the initial lexicon from this experiment. Future research should address whether a longer inter-stimulus interval between the presentation of the prime and the target would lead to the observation of priming effects.\n\nThe present dissertation contributes several open questions. One of them is if the cognate facilitation effect reported in @sec-chapter2 is present in other populations of bilinguals, namely those learning more lexically dissimilar languages. As mentioned in the Discussion section of @sec-chapter2, Catalan and Spanish share many cognates. The large amount of cognates shared by Catalan and Spanish may increase infants' sensitivity to cross-linguistic phonological similarity during vocabulary acquisition leading to cognateness playing a more central role than in the case of infants who encounter fewer cognates in their linguistic input. For instance, infants learning English and Mandarin, two languages that share very few cognates, may not be able to exploit cross-language similarity to boost the acquisition of words in both languages during language exposure. The approach followed by @floccia2018introduction [see also @siow2023double; @floccia2020translation] of collecting data from infants learning a diverse pool of language pairs would be convenient for addressing this issue.\n\nThe evidence provided in @sec-chapter2 in favour of an earlier age-of-acquisition of cognates does not address the particular mechanisms infants may use to accumulate information about word-forms and their association to their corresponding referents. We used the term *learning instance* [@mollica2017how] to refer to exposures to a word in which infants *may* use to consolidate its lexical representation. Determining the specific condition under which a learning instance is effective (i.e., may lead to word learning) falls out of the scope of the present dissertation. We simply assume that some learning instances may be effective, and that the number of effective learning instance is a function of the total number of learning infants a child encounters on a daily basis. An experimental approach to word learning, in which the impact of cognateness is investigated, would provide valuable insights into the mechanisms behind the role of cross-linguistic similarity on word acquisition.\n\nFor instance, a recent study by @tsui2023patterns provides a potentially suitable paradigm to investigate the impact of cognateness on online word learning. The authors designed a word learning task in which they tested bilingual infants aged 3-to-5 years of age, learning French and English (in Montreal, Canada), and Spanish and English (in New Jersey, United States). In the learning phase, participants were trained to associate novel labels to novel objects. At test, participants were presented with pairs of objects encountered in the learning phase, and a label that corresponded to one of them. Participants were instructed to select the corresponding object in a touchscreen. Participants completed two blocks of training and test phases. In the training phase of one block, participants were presented with sentences labelling the novel objects in both languages in an interleaved fashion. For instance, in one trial they would be presented with a novel object, which would be labelled in English (e.g., *gasser* in English). In the next trial, they would be presented with the same object, which this time would be labelled in French (e.g., *donquete* in French, or *sasco* in Spanish). This condition simulated a *language mixing* environment (i.e., children are exposed to both languages in the same situations, encountering words from both languages interleaved in speech), to which a sizeable proportion of bilinguals are exposed [@byers-heinlein2013parental]. In the training phase of the other block, participants were presented with consecutive trials labelling the object in the same language, and then with consecutive trials labeling the object in the other language. This condition simulated a *one-language-at-a-time* environment. Overall, participants succeeded at learning the words in both conditions. This suggests that infants benefit equally from being exposed to labeling events in alternating languages in an interleaved fashion (a bilingual environment) and in an synchronous fashion (monolingual situations).\n\n@tsui2023patterns used phonologically distinct novel labels across languages. By extending this paradigm it could be possible to investigate whether participants learning of the label-referent associations is facilitated by the degree of phonological between the TEs. If participants co-activate newly learned TEs in both languages, word learning should be facilitation more strongly by the repetition of phonologically similar TEs (i.e., cognates) than from the repetition of phonologically dissimilar TEs (i.e., non-cognates). Another variable of interest for such experimental paradigm could be the lexical similarity between the two languages being acquired. The two populations of bilinguals in @tsui2023patterns, ones exposed to French and English, and the others to Spanish-English, were learning two languages belonging to two different typological families. At the lexical level both pairs of languages are relatively distant, compared to languages belonging to the same family, like Catalan and Spanish. By comparing how bilinguals process cognates in world learning contexts, depending on the overall lexical similarity of their languages (e.g., high in the case of Catalan and Spanish, low in the case of Euskera and Spanish), it could be possible to investigate how the linguistic input shapes the strategies followed by bilinguals during early lexical development. In summary, future steps may involve experimental paradigms to investigate the mechanisms involved in the cognate facilitation of word acquisition with more details, and with a finer control of the conditions in which participants are exposed to the word-forms.\n\n\n## Conclusions\n\nThe present dissertation provides insights into the developing bilingual lexicon. We provided evidence in favour of a mechanistic account of word acquisition, in which bilinguals exploit the language non-selectivity of their lexicon to facilitate the acquisition of cognate words. These findings have important consequences for the current understanding of bilingual vocabulary growth, and in particular, the mechanisms underlying the parallel trajectories of lexical acquisition of monolinguals and bilinguals.\n\n\\clearpage"},"formats":{"upfthesis-pdf":{"identifier":{"display-name":"PDF","target-format":"upfthesis-pdf","base-format":"pdf","extension-name":"upfthesis"},"execute":{"fig-width":5.5,"fig-height":3.5,"fig-format":"pdf","fig-dpi":1000,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":"auto","echo":false,"output":true,"warning":false,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":true,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"pdf","fig-align":"center","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":true,"merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":["../_extensions/gongcastro/upfthesis/logo.png"],"shortcodes":[]},"pandoc":{"pdf-engine":"pdflatex","standalone":true,"variables":{"graphics":true,"tables":true},"default-image-extension":"pdf","to":"pdf","toc":true,"embed-resources":true,"include-in-header":["../_extensions/gongcastro/upfthesis/include-in-header.tex",{"text":"\\usepackage{tipa}\n\\usepackage{booktabs}\n\\usepackage{lscape}\n\\newcommand{\\blandscape}{\\begin{landscape}}\n\\newcommand{\\elandscape}{\\end{landscape}}\n"}],"filters":[],"output-file":"04-discussion.pdf"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table

Many have preceded me, and I hope many will follow---perhaps to the surprise of the reader, language acquisition remains unsolved at the conclusion of this research project. Though not the first one, I believe I have reasons to believe I have been the most privileged to do so. My privileges have often taken the form of people, and I want to spend some lines to appreciate their important role in the making if this dissertation.\n\nAquest camí comença amb la Prof. Núria Sebastian-Galles. Vaig conèixer a la Núria durant el segon semestre de 2018, quan feia el Màster en Neurociències a la Universitat de Barcelona. Núria em va acollir al seu grup, que es va convertir en casa meva en els darrers anys. Gràcies a la seva confiança i a tot el suport que m'ha donat, he pogut dedicar els darrers cinc anys a fer el que més m'agrada en el món: fer models bayesians i gràfiques amb R. També hem fet aquesta tesi pel camí. I si aquesta tesi existeix, és per tot el suport que la Núria em va donar: un suport acadèmic i administratiu que poques persones es troben. Amb la supervisió de la Núria he après una infinitat de coses: a ser més crític, a ser acurat en els detalls, a distingir el que és important i el que trivial, a utilitzar menys connectors en escriure, i a comparar la reproductibilitat d'un experiment amb la d'una truita de patata.\n\nI want to thank the Oxford team for the time together designing experiments, arranging stimuli lists, interpreting analyses, and thinking in general.

The mechanisms underlying this achievement are unclear. We investigated the possible role of cognateness---form-similarity across translation equivalents (TEs)---as a facilitator of bilingual lexical growth. We first modelled the acquisition trajectories of TEs, and found a facilitation effect of cognateness, only in the language of lower exposure. We provided a mechanistic account for this effect, rooted in the language non-selective hypothesis of lexical access. We then tested the plausibility of a central assumption in this account: that bilingual infants activate TEs in both languages in parallel, even during monolingual situations. We used a primed word recognition task in which participants were tested in exclusively one of their languages, while we covertly manipulated the cognateness of the prime words. Overall, we provide insights into the role of language non-selectivity in the initial bilingual lexicon.\n","abstract-catalan":"Els infants bilingües adquireixen paraules a un ritme comparable als monolingües, malgrat una exposició a un entorn lingüístic més complex.

Mitjançant una tasca de reconeixement de paraules a la que es va manipular la cognasticitat de las paraules experimentals de manera encoberta, s'ha posat a prova el pressupòsit de que els infants bilingües activen les TEs en ambdues llengües simultàniament en situacions monolingües. Aquesta tesi aporta coneixements significatius sobre el paper de la no-selectivitat lingüística en el lèxic inicial.\n","preface":"Talking about *talking*---an activity sometimes referred to as *Linguistics*---is painfully difficult. Language is the most complex communicative system known, yet few people are surprised by the fact that infants pick it up so early in life, and so effortlessly. Some of those few intrigued people are developmentalists, whose scientific enterprise has kept a lucky bunch of them out of unemployment. For the last five years, I have been one of them. In this dissertation, I present some of the contributions that have resulted from these years.\n\nWe addressed the case of bilingual infants or infants being raised in two languages. In particular, we investigated how such dual language exposure impacts the emerge of a mental lexicon, where phonological and conceptual representations find each other. We focused on the case of bilingual language acquisition as an extension of the monolingual case, which may provide insights about how language acquisition is shaped by different experiences with language.\n\nIt is known to the developmentalist that the trajectories of language acquisition of different infants may diverge substantially. Some of the sources of this individual variability have been identified and are under investigation. Cross-linguistic differences is one of them. Infants learning two different languages may follow slightly different paths towards language acquisition. This is also the case for bilingual infants. An influential monograph by @floccia2018introduction showed that the specific pair of languages that a bilingual child is learning affects their trajectories of vocabulary growth. In particular, they found that 24-month-old bilinguals were able to produce more words when their languages were lexically more similar (e.g., English-Dutch), compared to when both languages were lexically less similar (e.g., English-Mandarin). The motivation of this dissertation is to investigate the mechanisms underlying such facilitation effect.\n\nThe first goal of this dissertation was to provide a mechanistic explanation to the effect found by @floccia2018introduction. We focused on the role of *cognates* (i.e., phonologically similar translation equivalents). We tested the hypothesis that cognate words are acquired earlier by children than non-cognate words. This would explain why participants in @floccia2018introduction who were learning lexically similar languages---sharing many cognates---had larger vocabulary sizes than those learning two languages with less lexical similarity---sharing fewer cognates. We first put forward the foundations of a model that involved the interaction between lexical frequency, quantitative language exposure, and cognateness, to generate a cognateness facilitation on word acquisition. We then designed a vocabulary questionnaire, the Barcelona Vocabulary Questionnaire (BVQ), which we used to collect vocabulary data from monolingual and bilingual participants living in the Metropolitan Area of Barcelona. These participants were learning Catalan and Spanish, two Romance languages that share high lexical similarity. We modelled comprehension and production estimates of a large sample of children to test the predictions of our model of word acquisition.\n\nA second goal of this dissertation was to test the plausibility of a central assumption behind the model proposed in Chapter 2: that bilingual infants co-activate both languages during language exposure, even in monolingual situations. Previous studies had provided evidence in this direction, but had relied on paradigms in which participants were introduced into a bilingual environment while completing the task. We addressed this in Chapter 3. In collaboration with Prof. Kim Plunkett and Dr. Serene Siow, from the Universtity of Oxford, we designed an experimental task that would test the language non-selectivity of the developing bilingual lexicon in a purely monolingual context. For more than three years, we worked together, collecting data from a large cohort of monolinguals and bilinguals in both Oxford and Barcelona. Despite our efforts, methological complications kept us from being able to address the hypotheses of interest.\n\nThis was not the only setback we encounter during our research. The COVID-19 was an important set back for the project. First, it severely limited our access to participants for the experimental task in both locations. First, universities were completely shut down during the lock down imposed by the governments in both Spain and United Kingdom, meaning that access to laboratories was not possible, even for researchers. During these times, only online data collection could be conducted. Second, it became challenging to find participants, even after the lockdown was lifted. This was especially the case in Oxford, were bilingual participants were already hard to find. Some families did offer to us their time and interest, and took part in the testing sessions once the universities opened and the appropriate protocols were established. We are very grateful to them.\n\nThe timings and the aims of the project had to be adjusted to the circumstances. For instance, due to the tight schedule that we were left with after the lockdown, we decided to resume data collection in both laboratories in parallel. Initially, we planned to first conclude data collection in Oxford, were the original studies from which we adapted the experimental task were run. This would allow us to first replicate the original findings in the same population of monolinguals, making sure that the procedure would be an appropriate tool to test out hypotheses before moving to monolingual and bilingual infants in Barcelona. This was not possible. Unfortunately, we were unable to replicate the original findings, keeping us from drawing conclusions about our predictions in the experimental section of the present dissertation.\n\nDespite the setbacks encountered during the collection and analysis of the experimental data in Chapter 3, I believe the present dissertation provides valuable insights into the early stages of the bilingual lexicon. In the discussion section, we elaborate on the these contributions, putting our thoretical proposal from Chapter 2, its assumptions, and its implications, in the center. We present this proporsal as the Accumulator Model of Bilingual Lexical Acquisition (AMBLA). We illustrate the rationale behind this model by simulating word acquisition trajectories that mirror the results obtained in Chapter 2. We conclude this dissertation with a discussion on future experimental and modelling work to follow the formalisation of AMBLA.\n\nThroughout the preparation of this thesis, we put special attention into maximising transparency. The code used to run the experiments, and to collect and analyse the anonymised data, are accesible in the version-controlled GitHub repositories of their respective studies. I am aware that full computational reproducibility is not possible without a subtantial increase in the programming knowledge required from the reproducing researcher. I have made an effort to provide extensive documentation on the required steps for reproducing the analyses in this thesis. I have also made available a Docker image for each of the studies included in this dissertation. Opening this image should allow anyone to run the scripts in their local machine with all pre-installed dependencies in a relatively convenient way. Materials and results (e.g. heavy files, like model fits) are also available in the corresponding Open Science Framework repositories.
