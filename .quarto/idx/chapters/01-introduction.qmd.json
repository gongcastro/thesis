Being able to recognise familiar word-forms and retrieve their meanings The present thesis delves into the interface between concepts and speech sounds, known as the mental *lexicon*, and how it emerges during the first years of life. We consider the case of simultaneous bilinguals as a particular case of language acquisition that requires infants to deploy some additional strategies in their learning trajectories. We consider the bilingual case as a natural extension of the monolingual case, which may provide insights about the early lexicon in both populations. For this reason, this introductory Chapter 1 begins with a brief summary of monolingual language acquisition during the first year of life, from early linguistic experience, to the shift from language-universal to language-specific perception abilities, and the formation of the first phonological representations of familiar word-forms. We then characterise the case of bilinguals, with an emphasis on the relationship between the dual linguistic exposure their receive, and their trajectories of lexical acquisition. We point out some unresolved questions concerning the impact of linguistic similarity on vocabulary growth, and recent suggestions of a facilitatory role of cognateness. Next, we discuss the *parallel activation* hypothesis of such facilitation effect, contextualised within the language non-selective account of the bilingual lexicon. Finally, we summarise the available evidence of language non-selectivity in the initial lexicon, and the methodological issues therein encountered. We conclude this chapter describing the aims and structure of the present thesis.\n\n## The foundations of a lexicon\n\n### From sounds to word-forms\n\nInfants' earliest demonstrations of language familiarity trace back to their last weeks of pre-natal life. Hearing infants are exposed to auditory input from the 20th week of gestation [@eggermont2011morphological], and start reacting to sounds between 24 and 36 weeks [@dipietro2013physiological]. From 36 weeks on, foetuses notice when their carrier is talking [@voegtline2013near; @kisilevsky2009fetal; @decasper1980human], and can identify familiar melodies uttered by their carriers [@decasper1994fetal]. At birth, infants' perceptual abilities are already tuned to pre-natal experience with language. Newborns can discriminate between linguistic and non-linguistic sounds [@vouloumanos2004tuned; @ecklund1996asymmetric; @may2018specificity], and between their native language and some other non-native languages [@mehler1988precursor; @moon1993two]. These early language discrimination abilities are shaped by infants' familiarity with some suprasegmental properties of the native language, namely prosody [@gervain2018role]. For instance, during the first two months of life, language discrimination is restricted to pairs of languages from different rhythm classes [@nazzi1998language; @ramus1999correlates; @abboub2016prosodic; @ramus2000language; @byers2010roots; @pena2003sounds; @mehler1988precursor; @cooper1990preference]. It is not until six months of age that infants use segmental information to discriminate between their native language and others. Before six months of age, infants discriminate between virtually any pair of phonemes [@bertoncini1987discrimination; @eimas1971speech; @bertoncini1987discrimination; @aslin1981discrimination]. Between six and 12 months of age [but see @zacharaki2022before for evidence at earlier ages], infants' perceptual abilities start tuning to the phoneme repertoire of their native language. By their first birthday, infants can only perceive phonemic contrasts present in their native language [@werker1984cross; @werker1983developmental; @kuhl1991human; @best1994emergence; @kuhl2006infants; @segal2016effect].\n\nAs infants tune their speech perception abilities to the phoneme repertoire of their native language, they also start storing their first representations of familiar word-forms^[Attempting to provide a clear definition of *word* goes beyond the aims of the present thesis. We adhere to @jackendoff2002words's broad definition of *word* as a \"finite list of structural elements that are available to be combined through a finite set of combinatorial principles, or *grammar*.\"]. This task is not trivial. Infants are rarely exposed to single-word utterances. Instead, infants' speech input mostly consists of utterances and other multi-word combinations, providing isolated words in rare occasions [e.g., @aslin1996models]. To identify word boundaries, infants rely on multiple mechanisms and cues available in the speech signal, like phonotactics [@jusczyk1994infants; @friederici1993phonotactic; @friedrich2005phonotactic], phrase- and sentence-level prosodic contours [@soderstrom2003prosodic; @christophe1996bootstrapping; @gout2004phonological; @jusczyk1992perception], the predominant stress patterns of their native language [@thiessen2007learning; @cutler1990exploiting; @cutler1988role], or the statistical co-occurrence between syllables [@saffran1996statistical; @goodsitt1993perceptual; @saffran2001words]. By the end of their first year, infants recognise familiar word-forms [@vihman2004role; @halle1996format; @goodsitt1993perceptual], even if embedded in continuous speech [@jusczyk1995infants]. These initial phonological representations are encoded in great phonetic detail: when infants are presented with subtle mispronunciations of known word-forms (e.g., one phonetic feature apart), they struggle to recognise them as familiar [@swingley200511; @mani2007phonological; @ballem2005phonological; @tamasi2017pupillometry]. Being able to parse the speech stream into familiar word-forms is a critical milestone in early language acquisition: phonological representations of word-forms lay the foundations of an early lexicon.\n\n### Early word comprehension \n\n```{r wordbank}\nwb <- here::here(\"data-raw\", \"wordbank_administration_data.csv\") |> \n\tarrow::read_csv_arrow() |>\n\tadd_count(language) |>\n\tfilter(typically_developing,\n\t\t   monolingual,\n\t\t   language != \"English (British)\",\n\t\t   between(age, 10, 30))\n```\n\nInfants start building a lexicon early in age, as infants associate phonological representations of word-forms to referents and events^[Although the role of the grammar in the early lexicon falls outside of the scope of the present thesis, we acknowledge that grammatical information is incorporated in the lexicon, together with concepts and word-forms [@caramazza1997many; @krauska2023moving], but we do not adhere to any particular account of way in which grammatical information may be encoded in the lexicon.]. Evidence from inter-modal paradigms of word recognition [@hirsh1996intermodal; @delleluche2015methodological] have show that, by six months of age, infants are already forming their first lexical representations. For instance, Bergelson and Swingley [-@bergelson20126; -@bergelson2015early] presented pairs of familiar pictures to infants at different age points, from six to twenty months. In each trial, their caregiver named one of the pictures, participants' looking preference for the named picture  was measure, and was interpreted as a proxy of word recognition. Overall, the authors found evidence of target looking preference in all age groups, suggesting that word comprehension emerges from six month of age. This initial lexicon is sparse: according to parental reports of word acquisition in many languages, most infants barely understand more than 30 words before their first birthday [e.g., @bates1994developmental; @jackson1993early; @kern2007lexicon; @fenson1994variability]. Early comprehension is usually associated with words of high lexical frequency, which refer mostly to people, interjections, body parts, colours and food [@tardif2008baby; @parise2012electrophysiological; @tincoff2012six; @tincoff1999some; @frank2021variability; @forbes2019infants; @campbell2022scope; @marchman2002concurrent].\n\n### Vocabulary growth\n\nDuring the second year of life, this initial lexicon undergoes rapid development, in quantitative and qualitative terms. Evidence for this is mostly provided by parental reports of vocabulary size across ages, collected using the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventory (MCDI) [@bates1994developmental; @fenson1994variability], or its adaptations to other languages and populations. This questionnaire includes a vocabulary checklist contains a list of words---generally between 400 and 600 words---to which caregivers respond if their child *Understands*, *Understand and Says*, or if the child does not understand or say the word. The response options may vary between versions and adaptations of the questionnaire, but the end product is generally the same: an estimate of participants' receptive (number of words the child *understands*) or productive (number of words the child *says*) vocabulary size, obtained by aggregating caregivers' responses across words in the vocabulary checklist. Despite the apparent subjectivity of parents' answers, estimates of vocabulary size produced by the CDI show moderate to high intra-participant reliability [@reese2000predictive; @feldman2005concurrent; @rescorla2005concurrent; @frank2021variability] and evidence of concurrent and predictive validity (e.g., in experimental settings, participants are more likely to successfully recognise auditory words which their caregivers' have marked as acquired) [@jahn2001vocabulary; @pan2004measuring; @can2013long; @dale1991validity; @werker2002infants; @swingley2000spoken; @bates2013emergence; @robinson1999comparing].\n\n@fig-wordbank illustrates how rapidly children's vocabulary grows during their second year of age. This figure shows receptive and productive vocabulary size norms available in the Wordbank database [@frank2017wordbank], which contains responses to the CDI by families of children learning many different languages across the world. We show vocabulary size norms for `r format(n_distinct(wb$child_id), big.mark = \",\")` monolingual children learning `r n_distinct(wb$language)` distinct languages. As it can be seen in the figure, at 18 months of age, the average infant understands around 81 words and produces 42 words. At 24 months, they know around 243 words and produce 235 words. By 30 months, they understand around 507 words and produce 501 words. This rapid vocabulary growth, sometimes refered to as the *vocabulary spurt* [@goldfield1990early; @bloom2002children], impacts infants' trajectories of word recognition [@fernald2013ses; @fernald1998rapid; @marchman2008speed]. @fernald1998rapid examined the speed at which 15-to-24-month-old infants looked at named target pictures, compared to distractor pictures. Although infants of all ages showed a looking preference for the target pictures---suggesting successful spoken word recognition---older infants did so much faster. At 24 months infants started directing their gaze towards the target picture before the offset of the spoken label [see also @swingley1999continuous]. At 15-months, infants shifted their gaze only after the end of the spoke label. Overall, these results suggest an improvement in the efficiency of spoken word recognition during the second year of life. The mechanisms behind this accelerated lexical acquisition and processing are still under debate [@bergelson2020comprehension; @mcmurray2007defusing; @tomasello2000social; @bloom2002children].\n\n```{r fig-wordbank}\n#| label: fig-wordbank\n#| fig-cap: \"Wordbank norms for receptive (A) and productive (B) vocabulary size in monolingual children.

Many discontinuities and non-linearities in the performance of infants and adults in word recognition tasks can be explained as the result of differences in the size of the lexicon. For instance, evidence of *cascaded activation* in the developing lexicon emerges at around 21 months, associated to changes in the size of the lexicon. Cascaded accounts of lexical processing describe how activation spreads across representations at different levels in the lexicon, as the speech signal unfolds, and is one of the most defining features of the adult lexicon [@dell1986spreading; @levelt1989language]. Most of these accounts assume, at least, three levels of representation: conceptual, lexical, and phonological [@caramazza1997many]. Lexical representations embody associations between how words sound (*phonological representations*, or word-forms) and what words mean (*semantic representations*, or concepts). During word production and comprehension, representations from the three levels are activated (lexical access), and one of them is selected for comprehension or production (lexical selection). Which activations are activated across the three levels is determined by bottom-up and top-down sources of information. To illustrate this, we will focus on the dynamics of word comprehension (see @fig-lexicon-mon).\n\n![Lexical access and selection in the monolingual lexicon. The speech signal produced by a speaker uttering the Catalan word *COTXE* [car] activates phonological segments in the listener's mental lexicon. Activation then spreads across lexical representations containing such segments. In the illustration, a cohort of words also starting with phoneme /k/ is activated. The phonological form associated to the word *COTXE* receives the strongest activation, and is ultimately selected. In non-selected, but accessed, lexical representations, activation spreads also to the semantic layer, resulting in the activation of non-selected semantic representations. Note that, for simplicity, we have used phonemes to depict phonological units, but we acknowledge that phonological representations may be encoded at the lower level of phonetic features. ](../_assets/img/lexicon-mon.png){#fig-lexicon-mon}\n\nSpoken word recognition starts with the acoustic-phonetic processing of the speech signal. Phonological representations (e.g., articulatory features, syllables, stress patterns) in the listener's mental lexicon are activated according to how well they match the phonetic features and co-articulatory information in the speech stream. Lexical representations whose associated phonology matches the input are activated. The set of lexical candidates then is modulated by multiple factors: the degree of (mis)match with the unfolding acoustic input, the dynamics of competition between lexical candidates [@luce1998recognizing; @mcclelland1986trace; @norris1994shortlist], and top-down information like word frequency [@kukona2011time], or grammatical, suprasegmental, and semantic constraints provided by the sentential context [@marslen1988lexical; @tyler1983quantifying; @grosjean1980spoken]. Finally, the best-matching lexical representation is selected, and its associated meaning is activated for comprehension.\n\nThis sequence of events occurs in a *cascaded* fashion. Activation spreads within and percolates across levels of representation while lexical selection is still ongoing. Lexical representations sharing phonological similarity [e.g., @marslen1987functional; @marslen1978processing; @grosjean1980spoken; @mcclelland1986trace; @luce1990similarity] or semantic features [@neely1977semantic; @collins1975spreading; @mirman2009dynamics] are co-activated, and semantic representations of activated lexical units are in turn retrieved, even if their associated lexical representation is ultimately not selected. A clear example of cascaded activation at the phonological and semantic level was provided by @allopenna1998tracking. The authors designed a word-recognition task in which participants were presented, in each trial, with four objects in the screen. Participants would then listen to a command like \"Pick up the beaker; now put it below the diamond\", and perform the action. The authors manipulated the phonological relationship between the target object's label (e.g., *casket*), and the label of each of the three distractors. Two of the distractors were phonologically related to the target, sharing onset (e.g., *castle*) or offset (e.g., *basket*), respectively. The other distractor was phonologically unrelated to the target (e.g., *nickel*). After the onset of the auditory target label, phonological distractors attracted participants' eye fixations more than unrelated distractors. Distractors sharing phonological onset did so at an earlier time window than those sharing phonological offset. This time course of distractor fixations suggests that the auditory presentation of the target label activated no only its (subsequently selected) phonological form in participants' lexicon, but also that of phonologically related word-forms, leading to competition for selection between the word forms.\n\n#### Phonological and semantic priming\n\nPriming paradigms of word recognition have provided evidence of this cascaded activation in the developing lexicon. The rationale behind these paradigms is generally as follows: at the beginning of each trial, infants are presented with a prime word or picture that will activate its associated lexical representation. In a second part of the trial, a target word is presented, together with a pair of pictures. One of the pictures represents the referent of the target word. Participants' looking preference for the target picture---compared to the other (distractor) picture---is interpreted as evidence of target word recognition. By manipulating the semantic or phonological relationship between the prime and the target words, it is possible to investigate how word recognition is affected by the previous activation of related lexical representations.\n\nPriming paradigms of word recognition have provided a strong body of evidence for the existence of phonological and semantic links between early lexical representations between 18 and 21 months of age. @arias2009lexical found that infants' spoken word recognition (e.g., *dot*) was interfered by the previous presentation of a semantically related word (e.g., *cat*). This effect was found in 21-month-olds, but not in 18 month-olds. In the same line, @styles2009infants reported semantic priming in 24 month-old participants but not in 18 month-old participants. Other studies have provided electrophysiological evidence of semantic priming at earlier ages [e.g., @rama2013development; @friedrich2005lexical]. More recent studies have provided evidence for the emergence of such semantic links from 24 months onwards, even in the absence of visual referents during the experimental task [@willits2013toddlers]. Overall, semantic associations in the initial lexicon are in place before infants' second birthday. \n\nPhonological priming effects have also been reported to emerge around the same ages. @mani2010infant and @mani2011phonological created an implicit naming task in which each trial started with the *silent* presentation of a prime picture. Then, a target-distractor picture pair was presented side-by-side. Finally, the target picture's label was presented auditorily. The authors manipulated the phonological overlap between the prime label and the target label, so that in half of the trials both labels were phonologically related, sharing phonological onset (*cat*-*cup*), or phonologically unrelated (*ball*-*comb*). Prime and target-distractor pairs were semantically unrelated. At 18 and 21 months, English monolingual infants showed different target looking preference patterns after phonologically related prime pictures, compared to after phonologically unrelated primes. This suggests that infants implicitly named prime pictures---despite such pictures having been presented in silence---and that the phonology of the resulting labels interacted with subsequent target. The direction of the effect was different in both age groups. In 18 months, infants showed stronger target preferences after being previously presented with a phonologically related prime. On the other hand, 21 month-olds' target preference was weaker after phonologically related primes, compared to after phonologically unrelated primes.\n\n@mani2011phonological interpreted this shift from facilitation to inhibition as the result of the increased in vocabulary sizes of the older infants. The authors suggested that, in sparser lexicons, the fewer number of phonologically related lexical representations might have led to faster selection of the target word. In larger lexicons, lexical selection would delayed by the cascaded activation of a larger number of phonologically related lexical representations. In support of this hypothesis, the authors found a positive significant correlation between the size of the interference effect in 21 month-old infants with two critical variables: participants' vocabulary size, and the size of the phonological cohort of the presented words. A recent study by @avila2021longitudinal provided converging evidence from German monolinguals, in which larger interference effects were found in participants with larger vocabulary sizes, even after controlling for their age. @chow2017spokenword provided further evidence of the emergence of semantic *and* phonological links, associated to lexical growth. The authors adapted the Visual World Paradigm from @huettig2007tug to explore 24- to 30-month-old toddlers' visual fixation patterns during a word recognition when presented with phonological and semantic distractors. In each trial, the authors presented participants with four semantically and phonologically pictures. Four seconds after pictures onset, a word-form was auditorily presented. The word did not refer to any of the pictures displayed on the screen, but was phonologically related to one of them (both labels shared phonological onset), and semantically related to another one of the pictures (both referents belonged to the same taxonomic category. For instance, participants might be presented with the pictures of a sandwich, a bus, a cat, and a dress. Then they would hear the carrier phrase \"Look at the *bee*!\". The authors registered participants fixations to the phonological and semantic distractors, and found evidence of a preference for the phonological distractor at earlier stages of the post-naming phase, and a preference for the semantic distractor at later stages of the trial. These effects were stronger in participants with larger vocabulary sizes.\n\nIn summary, previous studies on lexical access in monolingual toddlers support a cascaded activation account of lexical access during the first stages of lexical development, and point to a continuity between the initial lexicon and the adult lexicon, bridged through vocabulary growth during the second year of life.\n\n## Building a lexicon in two languages\n\n### Characterising bilingualism\n\nIn lay terms, *bilingualism* can be defined as the regular use of two or more languages. For bilingualism research, this definition is no more than vague. Individuals may be labelled as *bilingual* for very different reasons. For instance, if a child is raised in a household where two languages co-exist, this child is conventionally considered bilingual. So would be an adult learning a second language later in age through formal instruction. The *bilingual* label suits both of situations, despite their radically different language experiences. The former case describes a *simultaneous bilingual*, who learns two languages in parallel during the first stages of their development. The latter case describes a *sequential bilingual*, whose is already native in one language at the time they start learning a second. The *simultaneous bilingual* will achieve native-level proficiency in both languages, equivalent to that of their monolingual counterparts. In contrast, the *sequential bilingual* will face severe limitations in their learning journey, as their prior language experience will constrain their language leaning abilities [see @costa2014how for review]. In summary, characterising bilingualism using one dimension or other (e.g., age of acquisition, second language proficiency) has critical methodological consequences for bilingualism research [@grosjean1997bilingual].\n\nSince the present dissertation concerns simultaneous bilingualism in infancy, we identify bilingualism with dual language exposure. This definition is useful to describe the linguistic experience of bilingual infants who participate in linguistic interactions almost exclusively as listeners. Quantitative language input is conventionally operationalised as the cumulative amount of time the infant has spent interacting with people who speak to them on a regular basis (e.g., parents, grandparents, siblings, daycare). For monolinguals, this is relatively easy to measure, since most people, if not all, talk to the infant in the same language. In bilinguals, this linguistic input is divided into two languages, which may be spoken by the same of different people, at the same time or at different times.\n\nSeveral instruments are available to measure language exposure in bilinguals, usually involving a semi-structured interview with the caregivers or detailed questionnaires that caregivers complete [e.g., @bosch2001evidence; @cattani2014much; @deanda2016language; @orena2020bilingual; @byers2020maple]. The end-product is generally a proportion of exposure to each of the languages, known as *Degree of Exposure* (DoE). The DoE reflects the cumulative amount of input that the child has received in one language, relative to the other. Although this measure is subject to biases and inaccuracies induced by the subjective judgements of caregivers, there is strong evidence of its external validity, as suggested by its high correlation with direct measures of infant-directed speech [@orena2020bilingual]. The underlying assumption behind this measurement approach is that a child's linguistic experience can be quantified into a continuous measure of bilingualism. This score ranges from 0% exposure to a second language in monolinguals to 50% in *balanced bilinguals*, with intermediate scores representing more *unbalanced bilinguals* (e.g., 25%). The language exceeding 50% DoE is refered to as the *dominant* language of the child, and the other language is refered to as the *non-dominant* language. For methodological simplicity, some studies classify monolinguals and bilinguals into discrete categories. Although there is not a universal threshold from which a child is considered bilingual, most of such studies considered a child as bilingual if the child is exposed to a second language at least 20% of the time [@byers2015methods; @byers2021multilab; @rocha2023defining] (see @fig-bilingualism for a visual illustration). This is the cut-off adopted in the present dissertation, whenever such classification into discrete groups is methodologically sound.\n\n![Bilingualism.](../_assets/img/bilingualism.png){#fig-bilingualism}\n\n### Bilingual word acquisition\n\nBilinguals acquire language in a more challenging set of circumstances than monolinguals. First, there is little reason to think that bilinguals receive a larger amount of language exposure than their monolingual peers. Given that bilinguals' linguistic input is divided into two languages, this means that they receive less exposure in each of their languages than monolinguals do. Second, bilinguals need to learn two codes, which might partially overlap: two phonologies, two grammatical systems, and two lexicons. Third, the referential context in which bilinguals build a lexicon is also more complex. On the one hand, bilinguals frequently learn at least two labels for the same referent, one for each language. On the other hand, the concepts behind both labels may not align perfectly. For instance, a child learning English and Spanish might learn the words *finger* and *dedo* (its Spanish translation). While both words might be used to refer to the same referent (e.g., the index finger), the word *finger* refers to eight appendices (four in each hand), whereas *dedos* refers to 20 appendices (five in each hand and five in each foot). In summary, bilinguals are presented with a more complex linguistic environment, facing additional demands compared to their monolingual counterparts.\n\nWhile these increased cognitive demands do not keep bilinguals from reaching their language acquisition milestones at similar ages as monolinguals, it modulates the trajectories followed by bilinguals [see @sebastian2020bilingual for review]. For instance, bilingual infants show evidence of language discrimination abilities slightly later than monolinguals [@bosch1997native; @bosch2001evidence], and possibly do so relying on different strategies [e.g., @byers2010roots; @weikum2007visual; @sebastian2012bilingual; @nacar2018evoked]. Bilinguals also tune their perceptual abilities to the phoneme repertoire of their native languages at similar ages as monolinguals, although their discrimination trajectories are different from monolinguals' for some phonemic contrasts [@bosch2003simultaneous; @albareda2011acquisition; @sundara2006language; @burns2007development; @sundara2008development]. Word-form segmentation abilities have been observed at similar ages in both groups [@nazzi2006early; @bosch2013rapid; @antovich2018learning; @houston2000role; @tsui2021dual; @polka2002role; @hurtado2014relative].\n\nDuring their second year of age, bilinguals also undergo the same increase in vocabulary size that monolinguals go through [e.g., @pearson1994patterns; @hoff2012dual; @core2013total]. As in monolinguals, spoken word recognition becomes more efficient as the infant's lexicon expands [@de2020lexical; @deanda2018lexical; @legacy2018vocabulary; @poulin2013lexical; @poulin2017translation]. These changes are dependent on the relative amount of input that the bilingual infant receives from each language. For instance, bilinguals acquire words faster, and become more efficient at spoke word recognition in their dominant language, compared to the non-dominant language [@thordardottir2011relationship; @cattani2014much; @hoff2003specificity; @shneidman2013counts; @floccia2018introduction; @marchman2010vocabulary]. Overall, the monolingual and the bilingual lexicons mature at a similar rate, but do they follow identical trajectories? Previous studies suggest this is not the case.\n\n@hoff2012dual collected vocabulary size data from a cohort of 103 infants at two age points at 22 and 30 months. Infants were being raised in English monolingual or English-Spanish bilingual homes in South Florida (United States). Both groups had equivalent socio-demographic backgrounds. Families of English monolingual infants filled the MCDI, and families of English-Spanish bilinguals filled the MCDI and its Spanish adaptation, the *Inventario del Desarollo de Habilidades Communicativas* [@jackson1993early]. When compared in their English vocabulary size, monolinguals were reported to produce a higher number of words, compared to bilinguals. English vocabulary size in bilinguals was associated with infants' amount of exposure to English: English-dominant bilinguals, raised in predominantly English speaking homes, showed the next largest English vocabulary size, compared to balanced or Spanish dominant bilinguals. Overall, English vocabulary size was showed to be a function of infants' exposure to English at home, with infants raised exclusively in English showed the largest English vocabulary sizes, followed by English-dominant bilinguals, balanced, and Spanish-dominant bilinguals, in that order. When the authors examined Spanish vocabulary sizes, they found a similar graded effect of Spanish exposed, in which Spanish-dominant bilinguals had larger Spanish vocabulary sizes than balanced in English-dominant bilinguals.\n\nResults from @hoff2012dual suggest that the relatively reduce amount of input that bilingual receive has a toll in their vocabulary growth in each language, when compared to monolingual infants. But single-language vocabulary size comparisons are an uneven ground in which to contrast the lexicon of monolingual and bilingual and bilingual children. When only one language is evaluated, many words in the other language that bilinguals may know are not counted [@bedore2005conceptual]. When both languages are summed together, the size of the lexicons of bilinguals are, overall, equivalent to those of monolinguals, or even larger [@pearson1993lexical; @pearson1994patterns; @poulin2013lexical; @core2013total; @byers2023sometimes; @bosch2014first]. For instance, when @hoff2012dual summed together the English and Spanish vocabulary sizes of bilingual participants into a measure of total vocabulary size, the trajectories of vocabulary growth of monolinguals and bilinguals were equivalent. This suggests that, despite acquiring words at a slower rate than monolinguals in their corresponding languages, bilinguals' lexicons have equivalent sizes to those of monolinguals when words in both languages are taken into consideration.\n\n```{r bilingual-vocabulary}\nbvq_data <- readRDS(here::here(\"data-raw\", \"bvq.rds\"))\np_tmp <- bvq_data$logs |>\n\tselect(child_id, response_id, lp, age, version, dominance)\n\nvocabulary_age <- bvq_data$vocabulary |>\n\tinner_join(p_tmp, by = join_by(child_id, response_id)) |>\n\tdrop_na() |>\n\tfilter(\n\t\t!grepl(\"long\", version),\n\t\tbetween(age, 10, 30),\n\t\tlp != \"Other\"\n\t) |>\n\tselect(child_id, response_id, type, age, lp, dominance, matches(\"count|prop\"))\n\nn_size <- count(distinct(vocabulary_age, response_id))\nn_size_lp <- count(distinct(vocabulary_age, child_id, lp), lp)\n```\n\nData collected in our group provide evidence in this line, suggesting that when both languages are taken into account bilinguals may know the same---if not more---more words than monolinguals (see @fig-bilingual-vocabulary). In line with @hoff2012dual's results, we found a graded effect of quantitative language exposure on vocabulary size. As expected, Catalan monolinguals and Catalan-dominant bilinguals show larger Catalan vocabulary sizes across ages in both comprehension and production. Conversely, Spanish monolinguals and Spanish-dominant bilinguals showed larger Spanish vocabulary sizes. Overall, most monolinguals showed non-zero vocabulary sizes in a second language, which is to be expected from the fact that few of them received no-zero exposure to a second language. More interestingly, total vocabulary sizes are higher in both Catalan-dominant and Spanish-dominant bilinguals, compared to Catalan and Spanish monolinguals. This contrasts with @hoff2012dual's results, and suggests that Catalan-Spanish bilinguals actually know more words than their monolingual peers across ages.\n\n\n```{r fig-bilingual-vocabulary}\n#| label: fig-bilingual-vocabulary\n#| fig-cap: \"Receptive and productive vocabulary size of monolinguals and bilinguals in Barcelona.

The analysis of the composition of the initial bilingual lexicon has provided some insights. Early accounts of bilingual word acquisition predicted that bilinguals might initially avoid learning cross-linguistic synonyms (henceforth *translation equivalents* or TEs) [@volterra1978acquisition], in a similar way monolinguals do with within-language synonyms [e.g., @markman2003use]. I was later shown that TEs are present in bilinguals' lexicons since early ages [@poulin2013lexical; @poulin2017translation; @tsui2022translation]. In fact, TEs might play a central role in the growth of the bilingual lexicon. For instance, @bosch2014first inspected the contents of the vocabularies of a sample of 18-month-old bilinguals learning Catalan and Spanish, who showed equivalent total vocabulary sizes to their monolingual counterparts. The authors found a large number of TEs. Most of the words in infants' vocabulary in one language had also been acquired in the other. This suggests a preferential acquisition of translation pairs during early lexical acquisition in bilinguals.\n\nIn line with this claim, @core2013total computed the *conceptual vocabulary size* of English-Spanish bilinguals, a measure that indicates the number of concepts a child has lexicalised. This measure is calculated by counting the number of TEs for which a bilingual child has a acquired at least one word in one of the languages. @core2013total and @byers2023sometimes found significantly lower conceptual vocabulary sizes in bilinguals, compared to monolinguals. In line with previous studies, total vocabulary sizes in both groups were equivalent. This suggests that bilingual participants in their sample preferentially acquired TEs, which increased the number of acquired words in total, at the cost of acquiring words for a smaller number of concepts. Modelling vocabulary data from English-Spanish bilinguals, @bilson2015semantic provided converging evidence of this semantic facilitation across languages. Models in which TEs were preferentially acquired---the acquisition of words for which the model had already acquired a translation was prioritised---fitted better the observer trajectories of word acquisition in bilinguals. Overall, these findings point to a cross-language facilitation during lexical growth, in which the acquisition of words in one language scaffold the acquisition of words in the other language. \n\nNot all bilingual populations have shown the same patterns of lexical development. For instance, studies in other populations of bilinguals have reported differences in total vocabulary size in monolinguals and bilinguals, and equivalent conceptual vocabulary sizes. This suggests that bilinguals may acquire a larger number of words across both languages than monolinguals, corresponding to an equivalent number of lexicalised concepts in both groups [@de2014bilingual; @siow2023double], or even higher [@kern2019lexical]. These results suggest that the specific pair of languages that bilinguals learn must be taken into consideration when investigating the early stages of lexical development.\n\n### Language distance and vocabulary growth\n\nParticipants in @hoff2012dual were learning English and Spanish. These two languages are relatively distant in typological terms. English is a Germanic language, while Spanish is a Romance language. In addition to their differences in grammar or phonology, English and Spanish also share fewer cognates (i.e., form-similar translation equivalents) than other pairs of languages like Italian and Spanish [@schepens2012distributions]. Recent studies have reported that bilingual learning two languages that share a higher amount of cognates may acquire words at a faster rate then those learning two languages sharing fewer cognates [@floccia2018introduction; @gampe2021does]. This might explain some of the variability observed in the characterisation of lexical growth across different bilingual populations.\n\n@floccia2018introduction conducted an impressive study in CDI responses were collected from a large sample of 372 bilinguals at 24-months of age. These bilinguals were learning English and an additional language---one of Bengali, Cantonese, Dutch, French, German, Greek, Hindi-Urdu, Italian, Mandarin, Polish, Portuguese, Spanish, and Welsh. Participants were being raised in the United Kingdom, and English was the dominant language for most of them. Using an edit distance-based metric of similarity, the authors calculated the phonological similarity between the translation equivalents present in the English vocabulary checklist, and in the vocabulary checklist of each of the other languages. The average phonological similarity between English and each pair of languages was taken as a proxy to their lexical similarity. Some language pairs shared high lexical similarity (e.g., English-Dutch), while others shared very little (e.g., English-Mandarin). The authors then estimated the association between lexical similarity and participants' language outcomes---measured as their receptive and productive vocabulary size in English and the additional language---while adjusting for the influence of other predictors like age, sex, socio-economic status, and several properties of participants' speech input. Bilinguals' vocabulary size in the additional language showed a lexical similarity effect, in which children learning two lexically similar languages showed larger vocabulary sizes in the additional language, while English vocabulary did not show such association with lexical similarity. Overall, these results suggest that infants might benefit from the lexical similarity between their languages--particularly, by the presence of cognates---and therefore bilinguals' trajectories of word acquisition should be considered in the context of the pair of languages being learned.\n\nA facilitation effect at the lexical level would have important consequences for infants learning highly similar languages. For instance, 98% of the translation equivalents acquired by bilingual participants in @bosch2014first were form-identical, indicating that the preferential acquisition of translation equivalents might be modulated by the lexical similarity of both languages. The relative typological distance between Catalan and Spanish is very small, especially at the lexical level. Both are Romance language, and share many cognates (i.e., form-similar translation equivalents). @fig-cat-spa-distance shows the overall lexical similarity between Catalan and Spanish, computed in the same way that @floccia2018introduction did. The lexical similarity between Catalan and Spanish is considerably larger than that of English and Dutch, the language pair with the highest similarity score in Floccia et al. This suggests that Catalan-Spanish bilinguals might be exposed to a substantially larger amount of cognates than bilinguals learning English and and additional language, like those in @floccia2018introduction and @hoff2012dual. If linguistic similarity, and especially lexical similarity, play a facilitative role in bilingual word acquisition, Catalan-Spanish bilinguals should show an even larger effect. This might explain why bilinguals in our database display larger vocabulary sizes than monolinguals, in contrast with the equivalent total vocabulary sizes reported by @hoff2012dual in English-Spanish bilinguals (learning two languages sharing less lexical similarity).\n\n```{r fig-cat-spa-distance}\n#| label: fig-cat-spa-distance\n#| fig-cap: \"Lexical similarity between Catalan and Spanish, and between English and each of the additional languages in FLoccia et al.

In this scenario, bilinguals learning languages that share more cognates would acquire words faster than those learning two languages that share fewer cognates. In line with this claim, previous studies had provided evidence in favour of an earlier age of acquisition for cognates. For instance some studies have reported a larger proportion of cognates in bilinguals lexicons than the proportion of non-cognates [@bosch2014first; @fabian2016investigating; @schelletter2002effect]. Other studies have found that bilinguals' performance in word recognition tasks is increased for cognate words, relative to non-cognate words [@gampe2018bilex]. More recent evidence in English-French bilingual suggest that cognates are may be more likely to be acquired than non-cognates at early ages [@mitchell2022cognates]. The specific mechanisms behind an earlier age of acquisition for cognates, however, are unclear. \n\n### The language non-selective hypothesis of lexical accesss\n\nTo explain the facilitation effect of lexical similarity on vocabulary growth, @floccia2018introduction suggested that the *parallel activation* of cognates during language exposure might boost their acquisition. The notion of *parallel activation* stems from the language non-selective hypothesis of bilingual lexical processing. This hypothesis states that bilinguals co-activate lexical representations from both languages during language production and comprehension, even in monolingual situations. This parallel co-activation is the result of cascaded activation spreading across the two languages at multiple levels of word recognition and production.\n\nFor instance, @marian1999activation presented Russian-English bilinguals with a series of trials that started with an auditory instruction like \"*Poloji marku nije krestika*\" [\"Put the stamp below the cross\"]. The instruction would be present in Russian (dominant language for most participants). The target object (*marku* [*stamp*], in this case) would be present in the screen, together with an object whose English label shared phonological onset with the target label (e.g., *mark*), and two unrelated distractors whose labels in Russian and English did not shared phonological relationship with the target label. Converging with @allopenna1998tracking's results in monolingual adults, after hearing the target label, bilinguals fixated the cross-language phonological distractor significantly more than the unrelated distractors. These findings suggest that participants activated phonologically related word-forms in both Russian *and* English, which affected their overt visual exploration patterns during the task. In this case, parallel activation is driven by bottom-up activation of words in both languages through phonology, at a sub-lexical level. Words that sound the same in both languages are activated, and enter the cohort during lexical selection. @fig-lexicon illustrates this sequence of events.\n\n![Lexical access and selection in the language-non selective bilingual lexicon. The speech signal produced by a speaker uttering the Catalan word *cotxe* [car] activates phonological segments in the repertoire of a Catalan-Spanish bilingual listener. Activation spreads across lexical representations in both languages that contains such segments. In the illustration, a cohort of words that also start with the /k/ phoneme are activated. The word-form associated to *cotxe* receives the strongest activation, and is ultimately selected. In non-selected, but accessed, lexical representations, activation percolates to the semantic layer, resulting in the activation of non-selected semantic representations.](../_assets/img/lexicon.png){#fig-lexicon}\n\nParallel activation can also be the result of top-down cascaded activation spreading across lexical representations in both languages. This is exemplified by the case of cognates. Cognates hold a privileged position in the language-non selective account of the bilingual lexicon, embodying the case of two lexical representations that belong to different languages, while sharing a common semantic representation (or at least, equivalent semantic representations), an a fair amount of form-overlap. Through the study of cognate processing, previous studies have provided strong evidence of parallel activation in exclusively monolingual tasks. In @costa2000cognate, Catalan-Spanish monolingual and bilingual adults were asked to name pictures of common objects in Spanish. In half of the trials, the object labels were cognates in Catalan and Spanish (*sofà*-*sofá*, translations of *sofa*)–whereas in the other half of the trials labels were non-cognates (*taula*-*mesa*, translations of *table*). Bilingual named cognate pictures faster than non-cognate pictures, even after adjusting for the lexical frequency of the items. Spanish monolinguals did not show this effect, as they were unfamiliar with the phonological form of the words in Catalan. These results suggested that, for the bilinguals, Spanish phonology was activated during cognate trials, facilitating the production of the Catalan word-forms.\n\nIn adults, the available evidence in favour of language non-selectivity in the bilingual lexicon is abundant across modalities [@gimeno2021cross; @giezen2016language; @van1998orthographic], and spans multiple languages  [@spivey1999cross; @bobb2020co; @duyck2005translation; @hoshino2008cognate; @marian2003competing; @colome2001lexical; @costa2000cognate; @thierry2007brain; @dunabeitia2009masked; @costa1999lexical]. Modelling efforts have successfully implemented formal accounts of the bilinguals lexicon by incorporating cross-language interactions [e.g., @kroll2010revised; @dijkstra2002architecture; @kroll1994category; @dijkstra2019multilink]. In summary, there is overall consensus around the fact that bilinguals co-activate both languages during word comprehension and production.\n\n### Parallel activation in the developing lexicon\n\nPrevious studies have provided evidence in of language non-selectivity in the initial bilingual lexicon [@bosma2020cognate; @jardak2019labels; @poulin2013lexical; @poulin2017translation; @singh2014one; @von2012language; @von2019impact; @poarch2012cross]. Priming paradigms of word recognition tasks have been instrumental in this line of research. Using one of such paradigms, @von2012language reported evidence of cross-language phonological priming in 21- to 42-months-old children learning German and English. At the beginning of each trial, the authors presented an auditory prime word in English. Then, the auditory target label was presented in German. Finally the target and distractor pictures were presented side-by-side. Participants' looking preference towards the target was recorded, and interpreted as a proxy of target word recognition. The authors manipulated the phonological overlap between the prime and target labels. In some trials, the English prime label and the German target label labels were phonologically related through translation: the prime label did *not* overlap with the target label in English (e.g., *leg*-*Stein* [*stone*]), but its translation in German did [*Bein*]. In the rest of the trials prime and target labels were phonologically unrelated in both languages. The authors found a stronger target picture looking preference in unrelated trials, compared to trials in the priming-through-translation condition. This suggests that participants activated the German translation of the auditory English prime word, and that this interfered with the recognition of the auditory German target word (which shared phonological similarity with the German translation).\n\nPriming studies in which words from both languages are presented during the same experimental session or even within the same trial [e.g., @von2012language; @floccia2020translation; @jardak2019labels; @singh2014one] present a critical methodological pitfall. In these tasks, participants are forced into a bilingual context, in which the overall degree of activation of lexical representations in both languages is artificially increased [@grosjean1997bilingual]. This might have contributed, to some extent, to the strength of the parallel activation reported in these studies. It is  possible that, in the daily life of a considerable proportion of bilingual children, speech input in each language takes place at separate times. If this is the case, the practical relevance of language non-selectivity in vocabulary growth might be smaller than anticipated.\n\nIn summary, the parallel activation hypothesis suggested by @floccia2018introduction to explain the cognateness facilitation effect relies on the language non-selectivity of the early lexicon. But experimental evidence for such language non-selectivity builds on experimental paradigms that may overestimate the amount of co-activation between the two languages, as they put participants in a bilingual context that might forcibly lead to both languages being active.\n\n## The present thesis\n\nThe aim of this thesis is to explore the impact of language non-selectivity on the developing bilingual lexicon, and its potential role in the facilitation effect of lexical similarity during vocabulary growth. In Chapter 2, we put forward an account of bilingual word acquisition, inspired in accumulator models of word language acquisition [@hidaka2013computational; @mcmurray2007defusing; @mollica2017data; @kachergis2022toward]. This model provides a mechanistic explanation for the facilitative effect of lexical similarity reported by @floccia2018introduction. It describes an interplay between the lexical frequency of a word, the child's relative exposure to each language, and cross-language phonological similarity. In this model, bilinguals accumulate experience with words in one language, even when listening to words in the other language. We contrasted this model against vocabulary data from bilinguals, collected using an *ad hoc* online questionnaire inspired in the CDI, adapted to the population of bilinguals learning Catalan and Spanish in the Metropolitan Area of Barcelona (Spain). We modelled the acquisition trajectories of 302 translation equivalents, testing the role of cognateness and its interaction with relative language exposure and lexical frequency with.\n\nThe predictions tested in Chapter 2 rely on the assumption that bilingual infants co-activate translation equivalents in both languages, even in monolingual situations. Although there is evidence in favour of cross-language activation in toddlers, previous studies have relied on experimental paradigms in which participants listen to words from both languages in each trials. This puts participants in a bilingual context in which parallel activation might be result of an overall stronger activation of both languages induced by the experimental task, and not because of regular cascaded activation across languages. In Chapter 3, we capitalise on the implicit naming paradigm by Mani and Plunkett [-@mani2010infant; -@mani2011phonological] to test parallel activation in an exclusively monolingual task. This paradigm consists on a prime word recognition task in which primes are presented in the form of pictures presented in silence. Previous studies have provided strong evidence suggesting that infants at 18 months and older lexicalise name-known pictures presented in silence [@duta2012erp; @styles2015infant; @mani2010infant; @mani2011phonological]. In particular, Mani and Plunkett found that word recognition is influenced by the prior presentation of a picture whose associated label is phonologically related to the target word. By manipulating the cognate status of the label associated to the prime image, we tested parallel activation in bilingual toddlers while avoiding the presentation of words in both languages.\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n```{r}\n#| label: setup\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(stringdist)\nlibrary(ggdist)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(patchwork)\n\n# set ggplot theme and colour palette\nmy_theme <- theme_minimal() +\n\ttheme(panel.grid = element_blank(),\n\t\t  axis.line = element_line(colour = \"black\"),\n\t\t  text = element_text(size = 12, colour = \"black\"),\n\t\t  axis.text = element_text(colour = \"black\"))\n\ntheme_set(my_theme)\n\nclrs <- c(\"#AA0E28\", \"#ED1D3F\", \"#F47B8F\", \"#70B3FF\", \"#004CA3\", \"#002147\")\n\noptions(\n\tggplot2.ordinal.fill = clrs[c(1, 4, 5)],\n\tggplot2.ordinal.colour = clrs[c(1, 4, 5)],\n\tggplot2.discrete.fill = clrs[c(1, 4, 5)],\n\tggplot2.discrete.colour = clrs[c(1, 4, 5)],\n\tggplot2.continuous.fill = ggplot2::scale_color_gradient,\n\tggplot2.continuous.colour = ggplot2::scale_color_gradient\n)\n\nset.seed(1234)\n```\n\n{{< pagebreak >}}\n\n\nOne of the main developmental milestones in language acquisition is the ability to make sense from the speech stream. \n\n, and retrieving their meaning. Being able to recognise familiar word-forms and retrieve their meanings The present thesis delves into the interface between concepts and speech sounds, known as the mental *lexicon*, and how it emerges during the first years of life. We consider the case of simultaneous bilinguals as a particular case of language acquisition that requires infants to deploy some additional strategies in their learning trajectories. We consider the bilingual case as a natural extension of the monolingual case, which may provide insights about the early lexicon in both populations. For this reason, this introductory Chapter 1 begins with a brief summary of monolingual language acquisition during the first year of life, from early linguistic experience, to the shift from language-universal to language-specific perception abilities, and the formation of the first phonological representations of familiar word-forms. We then characterise the case of bilinguals, with an emphasis on the relationship between the dual linguistic exposure their receive, and their trajectories of lexical acquisition. We point out some unresolved questions concerning the impact of linguistic similarity on vocabulary growth, and recent suggestions of a facilitatory role of cognateness. Next, we discuss the *parallel activation* hypothesis of such facilitation effect, contextualised within the language non-selective account of the bilingual lexicon. Finally, we summarise the available evidence of language non-selectivity in the initial lexicon, and the methodological issues therein encountered. We conclude this chapter describing the aims and structure of the present thesis.\n\n## The foundations of a lexicon\n\n### From sounds to word-forms\n\nInfants' earliest demonstrations of language familiarity trace back to their last weeks of pre-natal life. Hearing infants are exposed to auditory input from the 20th week of gestation [@eggermont2011morphological], and start reacting to sounds between 24 and 36 weeks [@dipietro2013physiological]. From 36 weeks on, foetuses notice when their carrier is talking [@voegtline2013near; @kisilevsky2009fetal; @decasper1980human], and can identify familiar melodies uttered by their carriers [@decasper1994fetal]. At birth, infants' perceptual abilities are already tuned to pre-natal experience with language. Newborns can discriminate between linguistic and non-linguistic sounds [@vouloumanos2004tuned; @ecklund1996asymmetric; @may2018specificity], and between their native language and some other non-native languages [@mehler1988precursor; @moon1993two]. These early language discrimination abilities are shaped by infants' familiarity with some suprasegmental properties of the native language, namely prosody [@gervain2018role]. For instance, during the first two months of life, language discrimination is restricted to pairs of languages from different rhythm classes [@nazzi1998language; @ramus1999correlates; @abboub2016prosodic; @ramus2000language; @byers2010roots; @pena2003sounds; @mehler1988precursor; @cooper1990preference]. It is not until six months of age that infants use segmental information to discriminate between their native language and others. Before six months of age, infants discriminate between virtually any pair of phonemes [@bertoncini1987discrimination; @eimas1971speech; @bertoncini1987discrimination; @aslin1981discrimination]. Between six and 12 months of age [but see @zacharaki2022before for evidence at earlier ages], infants' perceptual abilities start tuning to the phoneme repertoire of their native language. By their first birthday, infants can only perceive phonemic contrasts present in their native language [@werker1984cross; @werker1983developmental; @kuhl1991human; @best1994emergence; @kuhl2006infants; @segal2016effect].\n\nAs infants tune their speech perception abilities to the phoneme repertoire of their native language, they also start storing their first representations of familiar word-forms^[Attempting to provide a clear definition of *word* goes beyond the aims of the present thesis. We adhere to @jackendoff2002words's broad definition of *word* as a \"finite list of structural elements that are available to be combined through a finite set of combinatorial principles, or *grammar*.\"]. This task is not trivial. Infants are rarely exposed to single-word utterances. Instead, infants' speech input mostly consists of utterances and other multi-word combinations, providing isolated words in rare occasions [e.g., @aslin1996models]. To identify word boundaries, infants rely on multiple mechanisms and cues available in the speech signal, like phonotactics [@jusczyk1994infants; @friederici1993phonotactic; @friedrich2005phonotactic], phrase- and sentence-level prosodic contours [@soderstrom2003prosodic; @christophe1996bootstrapping; @gout2004phonological; @jusczyk1992perception], the predominant stress patterns of their native language [@thiessen2007learning; @cutler1990exploiting; @cutler1988role], or the statistical co-occurrence between syllables [@saffran1996statistical; @goodsitt1993perceptual; @saffran2001words]. By the end of their first year, infants recognise familiar word-forms [@vihman2004role; @halle1996format; @goodsitt1993perceptual], even if embedded in continuous speech [@jusczyk1995infants]. These initial phonological representations are encoded in great phonetic detail: when infants are presented with subtle mispronunciations of known word-forms (e.g., one phonetic feature apart), they struggle to recognise them as familiar [@swingley200511; @mani2007phonological; @ballem2005phonological; @tamasi2017pupillometry]. Being able to parse the speech stream into familiar word-forms is a critical milestone in early language acquisition: phonological representations of word-forms lay the foundations of an early lexicon.\n\n### Early word comprehension \n\n```{r wordbank}\nwb <- here::here(\"data-raw\", \"wordbank_administration_data.csv\") |> \n\tarrow::read_csv_arrow() |>\n\tadd_count(language) |>\n\tfilter(typically_developing,\n\t\t   monolingual,\n\t\t   language != \"English (British)\",\n\t\t   between(age, 10, 30))\n```\n\nInfants start building a lexicon early in age, as infants associate phonological representations of word-forms to referents and events^[Although the role of the grammar in the early lexicon falls outside of the scope of the present thesis, we acknowledge that grammatical information is incorporated in the lexicon, together with concepts and word-forms [@caramazza1997many; @krauska2023moving], but we do not adhere to any particular account of way in which grammatical information may be encoded in the lexicon.]. Evidence from inter-modal paradigms of word recognition [@hirsh1996intermodal; @delleluche2015methodological] have show that, by six months of age, infants are already forming their first lexical representations. For instance, Bergelson and Swingley [-@bergelson20126; -@bergelson2015early] presented pairs of familiar pictures to infants at different age points, from six to twenty months. In each trial, their caregiver named one of the pictures, participants' looking preference for the named picture  was measure, and was interpreted as a proxy of word recognition. Overall, the authors found evidence of target looking preference in all age groups, suggesting that word comprehension emerges from six month of age. This initial lexicon is sparse: according to parental reports of word acquisition in many languages, most infants barely understand more than 30 words before their first birthday [e.g., @bates1994developmental; @jackson1993early; @kern2007lexicon; @fenson1994variability]. Early comprehension is usually associated with words of high lexical frequency, which refer mostly to people, interjections, body parts, colours and food [@tardif2008baby; @parise2012electrophysiological; @tincoff2012six; @tincoff1999some; @frank2021variability; @forbes2019infants; @campbell2022scope; @marchman2002concurrent].\n\n### Vocabulary growth\n\nDuring the second year of life, this initial lexicon undergoes rapid development, in quantitative and qualitative terms. Evidence for this is mostly provided by parental reports of vocabulary size across ages, collected using the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventory (MCDI) [@bates1994developmental; @fenson1994variability], or its adaptations to other languages and populations. This questionnaire includes a vocabulary checklist contains a list of words---generally between 400 and 600 words---to which caregivers respond if their child *Understands*, *Understand and Says*, or if the child does not understand or say the word. The response options may vary between versions and adaptations of the questionnaire, but the end product is generally the same: an estimate of participants' receptive (number of words the child *understands*) or productive (number of words the child *says*) vocabulary size, obtained by aggregating caregivers' responses across words in the vocabulary checklist. Despite the apparent subjectivity of parents' answers, estimates of vocabulary size produced by the CDI show moderate to high intra-participant reliability [@reese2000predictive; @feldman2005concurrent; @rescorla2005concurrent; @frank2021variability] and evidence of concurrent and predictive validity (e.g., in experimental settings, participants are more likely to successfully recognise auditory words which their caregivers' have marked as acquired) [@jahn2001vocabulary; @pan2004measuring; @can2013long; @dale1991validity; @werker2002infants; @swingley2000spoken; @bates2013emergence; @robinson1999comparing].\n\n@fig-wordbank illustrates how rapidly children's vocabulary grows during their second year of age. This figure shows receptive and productive vocabulary size norms available in the Wordbank database [@frank2017wordbank], which contains responses to the CDI by families of children learning many different languages across the world. We show vocabulary size norms for `r format(n_distinct(wb$child_id), big.mark = \",\")` monolingual children learning `r n_distinct(wb$language)` distinct languages. As it can be seen in the figure, at 18 months of age, the average infant understands around 81 words and produces 42 words. At 24 months, they know around 243 words and produce 235 words. By 30 months, they understand around 507 words and produce 501 words. This rapid vocabulary growth, sometimes refered to as the *vocabulary spurt* [@goldfield1990early; @bloom2002children], impacts infants' trajectories of word recognition [@fernald2013ses; @fernald1998rapid; @marchman2008speed]. @fernald1998rapid examined the speed at which 15-to-24-month-old infants looked at named target pictures, compared to distractor pictures. Although infants of all ages showed a looking preference for the target pictures---suggesting successful spoken word recognition---older infants did so much faster. At 24 months infants started directing their gaze towards the target picture before the offset of the spoken label [see also @swingley1999continuous]. At 15-months, infants shifted their gaze only after the end of the spoke label. Overall, these results suggest an improvement in the efficiency of spoken word recognition during the second year of life. The mechanisms behind this accelerated lexical acquisition and processing are still under debate [@bergelson2020comprehension; @mcmurray2007defusing; @tomasello2000social; @bloom2002children].\n\n```{r fig-wordbank}\n#| label: fig-wordbank\n#| fig-cap: \"Wordbank norms for receptive (A) and productive (B) vocabulary size in monolingual children.

Many discontinuities and non-linearities in the performance of infants and adults in word recognition tasks can be explained as the result of differences in the size of the lexicon. For instance, evidence of *cascaded activation* in the developing lexicon emerges at around 21 months, associated to changes in the size of the lexicon. Cascaded accounts of lexical processing describe how activation spreads across representations at different levels in the lexicon, as the speech signal unfolds, and is one of the most defining features of the adult lexicon [@dell1986spreading; @levelt1989language]. Most of these accounts assume, at least, three levels of representation: conceptual, lexical, and phonological [@caramazza1997many]. Lexical representations embody associations between how words sound (*phonological representations*, or word-forms) and what words mean (*semantic representations*, or concepts). During word production and comprehension, representations from the three levels are activated (lexical access), and one of them is selected for comprehension or production (lexical selection). Which activations are activated across the three levels is determined by bottom-up and top-down sources of information. To illustrate this, we will focus on the dynamics of word comprehension (see @fig-lexicon-mon).\n\n![Lexical access and selection in the monolingual lexicon. The speech signal produced by a speaker uttering the Catalan word *COTXE* [car] activates phonological segments in the listener's mental lexicon. Activation then spreads across lexical representations containing such segments. In the illustration, a cohort of words also starting with phoneme /k/ is activated. The phonological form associated to the word *COTXE* receives the strongest activation, and is ultimately selected. In non-selected, but accessed, lexical representations, activation spreads also to the semantic layer, resulting in the activation of non-selected semantic representations. Note that, for simplicity, we have used phonemes to depict phonological units, but we acknowledge that phonological representations may be encoded at the lower level of phonetic features. ](../_assets/img/lexicon-mon.png){#fig-lexicon-mon}\n\nSpoken word recognition starts with the acoustic-phonetic processing of the speech signal. Phonological representations (e.g., articulatory features, syllables, stress patterns) in the listener's mental lexicon are activated according to how well they match the phonetic features and co-articulatory information in the speech stream. Lexical representations whose associated phonology matches the input are activated. The set of lexical candidates then is modulated by multiple factors: the degree of (mis)match with the unfolding acoustic input, the dynamics of competition between lexical candidates [@luce1998recognizing; @mcclelland1986trace; @norris1994shortlist], and top-down information like word frequency [@kukona2011time], or grammatical, suprasegmental, and semantic constraints provided by the sentential context [@marslen1988lexical; @tyler1983quantifying; @grosjean1980spoken]. Finally, the best-matching lexical representation is selected, and its associated meaning is activated for comprehension.\n\nThis sequence of events occurs in a *cascaded* fashion. Activation spreads within and percolates across levels of representation while lexical selection is still ongoing. Lexical representations sharing phonological similarity [e.g., @marslen1987functional; @marslen1978processing; @grosjean1980spoken; @mcclelland1986trace; @luce1990similarity] or semantic features [@neely1977semantic; @collins1975spreading; @mirman2009dynamics] are co-activated, and semantic representations of activated lexical units are in turn retrieved, even if their associated lexical representation is ultimately not selected. A clear example of cascaded activation at the phonological and semantic level was provided by @allopenna1998tracking. The authors designed a word-recognition task in which participants were presented, in each trial, with four objects in the screen. Participants would then listen to a command like \"Pick up the beaker; now put it below the diamond\", and perform the action. The authors manipulated the phonological relationship between the target object's label (e.g., *casket*), and the label of each of the three distractors. Two of the distractors were phonologically related to the target, sharing onset (e.g., *castle*) or offset (e.g., *basket*), respectively. The other distractor was phonologically unrelated to the target (e.g., *nickel*). After the onset of the auditory target label, phonological distractors attracted participants' eye fixations more than unrelated distractors. Distractors sharing phonological onset did so at an earlier time window than those sharing phonological offset. This time course of distractor fixations suggests that the auditory presentation of the target label activated no only its (subsequently selected) phonological form in participants' lexicon, but also that of phonologically related word-forms, leading to competition for selection between the word forms.\n\n#### Phonological and semantic priming\n\nPriming paradigms of word recognition have provided evidence of this cascaded activation in the developing lexicon. The rationale behind these paradigms is generally as follows: at the beginning of each trial, infants are presented with a prime word or picture that will activate its associated lexical representation. In a second part of the trial, a target word is presented, together with a pair of pictures. One of the pictures represents the referent of the target word. Participants' looking preference for the target picture---compared to the other (distractor) picture---is interpreted as evidence of target word recognition. By manipulating the semantic or phonological relationship between the prime and the target words, it is possible to investigate how word recognition is affected by the previous activation of related lexical representations.\n\nPriming paradigms of word recognition have provided a strong body of evidence for the existence of phonological and semantic links between early lexical representations between 18 and 21 months of age. @arias2009lexical found that infants' spoken word recognition (e.g., *dot*) was interfered by the previous presentation of a semantically related word (e.g., *cat*). This effect was found in 21-month-olds, but not in 18 month-olds. In the same line, @styles2009infants reported semantic priming in 24 month-old participants but not in 18 month-old participants. Other studies have provided electrophysiological evidence of semantic priming at earlier ages [e.g., @rama2013development; @friedrich2005lexical]. More recent studies have provided evidence for the emergence of such semantic links from 24 months onwards, even in the absence of visual referents during the experimental task [@willits2013toddlers]. Overall, semantic associations in the initial lexicon are in place before infants' second birthday. \n\nPhonological priming effects have also been reported to emerge around the same ages. @mani2010infant and @mani2011phonological created an implicit naming task in which each trial started with the *silent* presentation of a prime picture. Then, a target-distractor picture pair was presented side-by-side. Finally, the target picture's label was presented auditorily. The authors manipulated the phonological overlap between the prime label and the target label, so that in half of the trials both labels were phonologically related, sharing phonological onset (*cat*-*cup*), or phonologically unrelated (*ball*-*comb*). Prime and target-distractor pairs were semantically unrelated. At 18 and 21 months, English monolingual infants showed different target looking preference patterns after phonologically related prime pictures, compared to after phonologically unrelated primes. This suggests that infants implicitly named prime pictures---despite such pictures having been presented in silence---and that the phonology of the resulting labels interacted with subsequent target. The direction of the effect was different in both age groups. In 18 months, infants showed stronger target preferences after being previously presented with a phonologically related prime. On the other hand, 21 month-olds' target preference was weaker after phonologically related primes, compared to after phonologically unrelated primes.\n\n@mani2011phonological interpreted this shift from facilitation to inhibition as the result of the increased in vocabulary sizes of the older infants. The authors suggested that, in sparser lexicons, the fewer number of phonologically related lexical representations might have led to faster selection of the target word. In larger lexicons, lexical selection would delayed by the cascaded activation of a larger number of phonologically related lexical representations. In support of this hypothesis, the authors found a positive significant correlation between the size of the interference effect in 21 month-old infants with two critical variables: participants' vocabulary size, and the size of the phonological cohort of the presented words. A recent study by @avila2021longitudinal provided converging evidence from German monolinguals, in which larger interference effects were found in participants with larger vocabulary sizes, even after controlling for their age. @chow2017spokenword provided further evidence of the emergence of semantic *and* phonological links, associated to lexical growth. The authors adapted the Visual World Paradigm from @huettig2007tug to explore 24- to 30-month-old toddlers' visual fixation patterns during a word recognition when presented with phonological and semantic distractors. In each trial, the authors presented participants with four semantically and phonologically pictures. Four seconds after pictures onset, a word-form was auditorily presented. The word did not refer to any of the pictures displayed on the screen, but was phonologically related to one of them (both labels shared phonological onset), and semantically related to another one of the pictures (both referents belonged to the same taxonomic category. For instance, participants might be presented with the pictures of a sandwich, a bus, a cat, and a dress. Then they would hear the carrier phrase \"Look at the *bee*!\". The authors registered participants fixations to the phonological and semantic distractors, and found evidence of a preference for the phonological distractor at earlier stages of the post-naming phase, and a preference for the semantic distractor at later stages of the trial. These effects were stronger in participants with larger vocabulary sizes.\n\nIn summary, previous studies on lexical access in monolingual toddlers support a cascaded activation account of lexical access during the first stages of lexical development, and point to a continuity between the initial lexicon and the adult lexicon, bridged through vocabulary growth during the second year of life.\n\n## Building a lexicon in two languages\n\n### Characterising bilingualism\n\nIn lay terms, *bilingualism* can be defined as the regular use of two or more languages. For bilingualism research, this definition is no more than vague. Individuals may be labelled as *bilingual* for very different reasons. For instance, if a child is raised in a household where two languages co-exist, this child is conventionally considered bilingual. So would be an adult learning a second language later in age through formal instruction. The *bilingual* label suits both of situations, despite their radically different language experiences. The former case describes a *simultaneous bilingual*, who learns two languages in parallel during the first stages of their development. The latter case describes a *sequential bilingual*, whose is already native in one language at the time they start learning a second. The *simultaneous bilingual* will achieve native-level proficiency in both languages, equivalent to that of their monolingual counterparts. In contrast, the *sequential bilingual* will face severe limitations in their learning journey, as their prior language experience will constrain their language leaning abilities [see @costa2014how for review]. In summary, characterising bilingualism using one dimension or other (e.g., age of acquisition, second language proficiency) has critical methodological consequences for bilingualism research [@grosjean1997bilingual].\n\nSince the present dissertation concerns simultaneous bilingualism in infancy, we identify bilingualism with dual language exposure. This definition is useful to describe the linguistic experience of bilingual infants who participate in linguistic interactions almost exclusively as listeners. Quantitative language input is conventionally operationalised as the cumulative amount of time the infant has spent interacting with people who speak to them on a regular basis (e.g., parents, grandparents, siblings, daycare). For monolinguals, this is relatively easy to measure, since most people, if not all, talk to the infant in the same language. In bilinguals, this linguistic input is divided into two languages, which may be spoken by the same of different people, at the same time or at different times.\n\nSeveral instruments are available to measure language exposure in bilinguals, usually involving a semi-structured interview with the caregivers or detailed questionnaires that caregivers complete [e.g., @bosch2001evidence; @cattani2014much; @deanda2016language; @orena2020bilingual; @byers2020maple]. The end-product is generally a proportion of exposure to each of the languages, known as *Degree of Exposure* (DoE). The DoE reflects the cumulative amount of input that the child has received in one language, relative to the other. Although this measure is subject to biases and inaccuracies induced by the subjective judgements of caregivers, there is strong evidence of its external validity, as suggested by its high correlation with direct measures of infant-directed speech [@orena2020bilingual]. The underlying assumption behind this measurement approach is that a child's linguistic experience can be quantified into a continuous measure of bilingualism. This score ranges from 0% exposure to a second language in monolinguals to 50% in *balanced bilinguals*, with intermediate scores representing more *unbalanced bilinguals* (e.g., 25%). The language exceeding 50% DoE is refered to as the *dominant* language of the child, and the other language is refered to as the *non-dominant* language. For methodological simplicity, some studies classify monolinguals and bilinguals into discrete categories. Although there is not a universal threshold from which a child is considered bilingual, most of such studies considered a child as bilingual if the child is exposed to a second language at least 20% of the time [@byers2015methods; @byers2021multilab; @rocha2023defining] (see @fig-bilingualism for a visual illustration). This is the cut-off adopted in the present dissertation, whenever such classification into discrete groups is methodologically sound.\n\n![Bilingualism.](../_assets/img/bilingualism.png){#fig-bilingualism}\n\n### Bilingual word acquisition\n\nBilinguals acquire language in a more challenging set of circumstances than monolinguals. First, there is little reason to think that bilinguals receive a larger amount of language exposure than their monolingual peers. Given that bilinguals' linguistic input is divided into two languages, this means that they receive less exposure in each of their languages than monolinguals do. Second, bilinguals need to learn two codes, which might partially overlap: two phonologies, two grammatical systems, and two lexicons. Third, the referential context in which bilinguals build a lexicon is also more complex. On the one hand, bilinguals frequently learn at least two labels for the same referent, one for each language. On the other hand, the concepts behind both labels may not align perfectly. For instance, a child learning English and Spanish might learn the words *finger* and *dedo* (its Spanish translation). While both words might be used to refer to the same referent (e.g., the index finger), the word *finger* refers to eight appendices (four in each hand), whereas *dedos* refers to 20 appendices (five in each hand and five in each foot). In summary, bilinguals are presented with a more complex linguistic environment, facing additional demands compared to their monolingual counterparts.\n\nWhile these increased cognitive demands do not keep bilinguals from reaching their language acquisition milestones at similar ages as monolinguals, it modulates the trajectories followed by bilinguals [see @sebastian2020bilingual for review]. For instance, bilingual infants show evidence of language discrimination abilities slightly later than monolinguals [@bosch1997native; @bosch2001evidence], and possibly do so relying on different strategies [e.g., @byers2010roots; @weikum2007visual; @sebastian2012bilingual; @nacar2018evoked]. Bilinguals also tune their perceptual abilities to the phoneme repertoire of their native languages at similar ages as monolinguals, although their discrimination trajectories are different from monolinguals' for some phonemic contrasts [@bosch2003simultaneous; @albareda2011acquisition; @sundara2006language; @burns2007development; @sundara2008development]. Word-form segmentation abilities have been observed at similar ages in both groups [@nazzi2006early; @bosch2013rapid; @antovich2018learning; @houston2000role; @tsui2021dual; @polka2002role; @hurtado2014relative].\n\nDuring their second year of age, bilinguals also undergo the same increase in vocabulary size that monolinguals go through [e.g., @pearson1994patterns; @hoff2012dual; @core2013total]. As in monolinguals, spoken word recognition becomes more efficient as the infant's lexicon expands [@de2020lexical; @deanda2018lexical; @legacy2018vocabulary; @poulin2013lexical; @poulin2017translation]. These changes are dependent on the relative amount of input that the bilingual infant receives from each language. For instance, bilinguals acquire words faster, and become more efficient at spoke word recognition in their dominant language, compared to the non-dominant language [@thordardottir2011relationship; @cattani2014much; @hoff2003specificity; @shneidman2013counts; @floccia2018introduction; @marchman2010vocabulary]. Overall, the monolingual and the bilingual lexicons mature at a similar rate, but do they follow identical trajectories? Previous studies suggest this is not the case.\n\n@hoff2012dual collected vocabulary size data from a cohort of 103 infants at two age points at 22 and 30 months. Infants were being raised in English monolingual or English-Spanish bilingual homes in South Florida (United States). Both groups had equivalent socio-demographic backgrounds. Families of English monolingual infants filled the MCDI, and families of English-Spanish bilinguals filled the MCDI and its Spanish adaptation, the *Inventario del Desarollo de Habilidades Communicativas* [@jackson1993early]. When compared in their English vocabulary size, monolinguals were reported to produce a higher number of words, compared to bilinguals. English vocabulary size in bilinguals was associated with infants' amount of exposure to English: English-dominant bilinguals, raised in predominantly English speaking homes, showed the next largest English vocabulary size, compared to balanced or Spanish dominant bilinguals. Overall, English vocabulary size was showed to be a function of infants' exposure to English at home, with infants raised exclusively in English showed the largest English vocabulary sizes, followed by English-dominant bilinguals, balanced, and Spanish-dominant bilinguals, in that order. When the authors examined Spanish vocabulary sizes, they found a similar graded effect of Spanish exposed, in which Spanish-dominant bilinguals had larger Spanish vocabulary sizes than balanced in English-dominant bilinguals.\n\nResults from @hoff2012dual suggest that the relatively reduce amount of input that bilingual receive has a toll in their vocabulary growth in each language, when compared to monolingual infants. But single-language vocabulary size comparisons are an uneven ground in which to contrast the lexicon of monolingual and bilingual and bilingual children. When only one language is evaluated, many words in the other language that bilinguals may know are not counted [@bedore2005conceptual]. When both languages are summed together, the size of the lexicons of bilinguals are, overall, equivalent to those of monolinguals, or even larger [@pearson1993lexical; @pearson1994patterns; @poulin2013lexical; @core2013total; @byers2023sometimes; @bosch2014first]. For instance, when @hoff2012dual summed together the English and Spanish vocabulary sizes of bilingual participants into a measure of total vocabulary size, the trajectories of vocabulary growth of monolinguals and bilinguals were equivalent. This suggests that, despite acquiring words at a slower rate than monolinguals in their corresponding languages, bilinguals' lexicons have equivalent sizes to those of monolinguals when words in both languages are taken into consideration.\n\n```{r bilingual-vocabulary}\nbvq_data <- readRDS(here::here(\"data-raw\", \"bvq.rds\"))\np_tmp <- bvq_data$logs |>\n\tselect(child_id, response_id, lp, age, version, dominance)\n\nvocabulary_age <- bvq_data$vocabulary |>\n\tinner_join(p_tmp, by = join_by(child_id, response_id)) |>\n\tdrop_na() |>\n\tfilter(\n\t\t!grepl(\"long\", version),\n\t\tbetween(age, 10, 30),\n\t\tlp != \"Other\"\n\t) |>\n\tselect(child_id, response_id, type, age, lp, dominance, matches(\"count|prop\"))\n\nn_size <- count(distinct(vocabulary_age, response_id))\nn_size_lp <- count(distinct(vocabulary_age, child_id, lp), lp)\n```\n\nData collected in our group provide evidence in this line, suggesting that when both languages are taken into account bilinguals may know the same---if not more---more words than monolinguals (see @fig-bilingual-vocabulary). In line with @hoff2012dual's results, we found a graded effect of quantitative language exposure on vocabulary size. As expected, Catalan monolinguals and Catalan-dominant bilinguals show larger Catalan vocabulary sizes across ages in both comprehension and production. Conversely, Spanish monolinguals and Spanish-dominant bilinguals showed larger Spanish vocabulary sizes. Overall, most monolinguals showed non-zero vocabulary sizes in a second language, which is to be expected from the fact that few of them received no-zero exposure to a second language. More interestingly, total vocabulary sizes are higher in both Catalan-dominant and Spanish-dominant bilinguals, compared to Catalan and Spanish monolinguals. This contrasts with @hoff2012dual's results, and suggests that Catalan-Spanish bilinguals actually know more words than their monolingual peers across ages.\n\n\n```{r fig-bilingual-vocabulary}\n#| label: fig-bilingual-vocabulary\n#| fig-cap: \"Receptive and productive vocabulary size of monolinguals and bilinguals in Barcelona.

The analysis of the composition of the initial bilingual lexicon has provided some insights. Early accounts of bilingual word acquisition predicted that bilinguals might initially avoid learning cross-linguistic synonyms (henceforth *translation equivalents* or TEs) [@volterra1978acquisition], in a similar way monolinguals do with within-language synonyms [e.g., @markman2003use]. I was later shown that TEs are present in bilinguals' lexicons since early ages [@poulin2013lexical; @poulin2017translation; @tsui2022translation]. In fact, TEs might play a central role in the growth of the bilingual lexicon. For instance, @bosch2014first inspected the contents of the vocabularies of a sample of 18-month-old bilinguals learning Catalan and Spanish, who showed equivalent total vocabulary sizes to their monolingual counterparts. The authors found a large number of TEs. Most of the words in infants' vocabulary in one language had also been acquired in the other. This suggests a preferential acquisition of translation pairs during early lexical acquisition in bilinguals.\n\nIn line with this claim, @core2013total computed the *conceptual vocabulary size* of English-Spanish bilinguals, a measure that indicates the number of concepts a child has lexicalised. This measure is calculated by counting the number of TEs for which a bilingual child has a acquired at least one word in one of the languages. @core2013total and @byers2023sometimes found significantly lower conceptual vocabulary sizes in bilinguals, compared to monolinguals. In line with previous studies, total vocabulary sizes in both groups were equivalent. This suggests that bilingual participants in their sample preferentially acquired TEs, which increased the number of acquired words in total, at the cost of acquiring words for a smaller number of concepts. Modelling vocabulary data from English-Spanish bilinguals, @bilson2015semantic provided converging evidence of this semantic facilitation across languages. Models in which TEs were preferentially acquired---the acquisition of words for which the model had already acquired a translation was prioritised---fitted better the observer trajectories of word acquisition in bilinguals. Overall, these findings point to a cross-language facilitation during lexical growth, in which the acquisition of words in one language scaffold the acquisition of words in the other language. \n\nNot all bilingual populations have shown the same patterns of lexical development. For instance, studies in other populations of bilinguals have reported differences in total vocabulary size in monolinguals and bilinguals, and equivalent conceptual vocabulary sizes. This suggests that bilinguals may acquire a larger number of words across both languages than monolinguals, corresponding to an equivalent number of lexicalised concepts in both groups [@de2014bilingual; @siow2023double], or even higher [@kern2019lexical]. These results suggest that the specific pair of languages that bilinguals learn must be taken into consideration when investigating the early stages of lexical development.\n\n### Language distance and vocabulary growth\n\nParticipants in @hoff2012dual were learning English and Spanish. These two languages are relatively distant in typological terms. English is a Germanic language, while Spanish is a Romance language. In addition to their differences in grammar or phonology, English and Spanish also share fewer cognates (i.e., form-similar translation equivalents) than other pairs of languages like Italian and Spanish [@schepens2012distributions]. Recent studies have reported that bilingual learning two languages that share a higher amount of cognates may acquire words at a faster rate then those learning two languages sharing fewer cognates [@floccia2018introduction; @gampe2021does]. This might explain some of the variability observed in the characterisation of lexical growth across different bilingual populations.\n\n@floccia2018introduction conducted an impressive study in CDI responses were collected from a large sample of 372 bilinguals at 24-months of age. These bilinguals were learning English and an additional language---one of Bengali, Cantonese, Dutch, French, German, Greek, Hindi-Urdu, Italian, Mandarin, Polish, Portuguese, Spanish, and Welsh. Participants were being raised in the United Kingdom, and English was the dominant language for most of them. Using an edit distance-based metric of similarity, the authors calculated the phonological similarity between the translation equivalents present in the English vocabulary checklist, and in the vocabulary checklist of each of the other languages. The average phonological similarity between English and each pair of languages was taken as a proxy to their lexical similarity. Some language pairs shared high lexical similarity (e.g., English-Dutch), while others shared very little (e.g., English-Mandarin). The authors then estimated the association between lexical similarity and participants' language outcomes---measured as their receptive and productive vocabulary size in English and the additional language---while adjusting for the influence of other predictors like age, sex, socio-economic status, and several properties of participants' speech input. Bilinguals' vocabulary size in the additional language showed a lexical similarity effect, in which children learning two lexically similar languages showed larger vocabulary sizes in the additional language, while English vocabulary did not show such association with lexical similarity. Overall, these results suggest that infants might benefit from the lexical similarity between their languages--particularly, by the presence of cognates---and therefore bilinguals' trajectories of word acquisition should be considered in the context of the pair of languages being learned.\n\nA facilitation effect at the lexical level would have important consequences for infants learning highly similar languages. For instance, 98% of the translation equivalents acquired by bilingual participants in @bosch2014first were form-identical, indicating that the preferential acquisition of translation equivalents might be modulated by the lexical similarity of both languages. The relative typological distance between Catalan and Spanish is very small, especially at the lexical level. Both are Romance language, and share many cognates (i.e., form-similar translation equivalents). @fig-cat-spa-distance shows the overall lexical similarity between Catalan and Spanish, computed in the same way that @floccia2018introduction did. The lexical similarity between Catalan and Spanish is considerably larger than that of English and Dutch, the language pair with the highest similarity score in Floccia et al. This suggests that Catalan-Spanish bilinguals might be exposed to a substantially larger amount of cognates than bilinguals learning English and and additional language, like those in @floccia2018introduction and @hoff2012dual. If linguistic similarity, and especially lexical similarity, play a facilitative role in bilingual word acquisition, Catalan-Spanish bilinguals should show an even larger effect. This might explain why bilinguals in our database display larger vocabulary sizes than monolinguals, in contrast with the equivalent total vocabulary sizes reported by @hoff2012dual in English-Spanish bilinguals (learning two languages sharing less lexical similarity).\n\n```{r fig-cat-spa-distance}\n#| label: fig-cat-spa-distance\n#| fig-cap: \"Lexical similarity between Catalan and Spanish, and between English and each of the additional languages in FLoccia et al.

In this scenario, bilinguals learning languages that share more cognates would acquire words faster than those learning two languages that share fewer cognates. In line with this claim, previous studies had provided evidence in favour of an earlier age of acquisition for cognates. For instance some studies have reported a larger proportion of cognates in bilinguals lexicons than the proportion of non-cognates [@bosch2014first; @fabian2016investigating; @schelletter2002effect]. Other studies have found that bilinguals' performance in word recognition tasks is increased for cognate words, relative to non-cognate words [@gampe2018bilex]. More recent evidence in English-French bilingual suggest that cognates are may be more likely to be acquired than non-cognates at early ages [@mitchell2022cognates]. The specific mechanisms behind an earlier age of acquisition for cognates, however, are unclear. \n\n### The language non-selective hypothesis of lexical accesss\n\nTo explain the facilitation effect of lexical similarity on vocabulary growth, @floccia2018introduction suggested that the *parallel activation* of cognates during language exposure might boost their acquisition. The notion of *parallel activation* stems from the language non-selective hypothesis of bilingual lexical processing. This hypothesis states that bilinguals co-activate lexical representations from both languages during language production and comprehension, even in monolingual situations. This parallel co-activation is the result of cascaded activation spreading across the two languages at multiple levels of word recognition and production.\n\nFor instance, @marian1999activation presented Russian-English bilinguals with a series of trials that started with an auditory instruction like \"*Poloji marku nije krestika*\" [\"Put the stamp below the cross\"]. The instruction would be present in Russian (dominant language for most participants). The target object (*marku* [*stamp*], in this case) would be present in the screen, together with an object whose English label shared phonological onset with the target label (e.g., *mark*), and two unrelated distractors whose labels in Russian and English did not shared phonological relationship with the target label. Converging with @allopenna1998tracking's results in monolingual adults, after hearing the target label, bilinguals fixated the cross-language phonological distractor significantly more than the unrelated distractors. These findings suggest that participants activated phonologically related word-forms in both Russian *and* English, which affected their overt visual exploration patterns during the task. In this case, parallel activation is driven by bottom-up activation of words in both languages through phonology, at a sub-lexical level. Words that sound the same in both languages are activated, and enter the cohort during lexical selection. @fig-lexicon illustrates this sequence of events.\n\n![Lexical access and selection in the language-non selective bilingual lexicon. The speech signal produced by a speaker uttering the Catalan word *cotxe* [car] activates phonological segments in the repertoire of a Catalan-Spanish bilingual listener. Activation spreads across lexical representations in both languages that contains such segments. In the illustration, a cohort of words that also start with the /k/ phoneme are activated. The word-form associated to *cotxe* receives the strongest activation, and is ultimately selected. In non-selected, but accessed, lexical representations, activation percolates to the semantic layer, resulting in the activation of non-selected semantic representations.](../_assets/img/lexicon.png){#fig-lexicon}\n\nParallel activation can also be the result of top-down cascaded activation spreading across lexical representations in both languages. This is exemplified by the case of cognates. Cognates hold a privileged position in the language-non selective account of the bilingual lexicon, embodying the case of two lexical representations that belong to different languages, while sharing a common semantic representation (or at least, equivalent semantic representations), an a fair amount of form-overlap. Through the study of cognate processing, previous studies have provided strong evidence of parallel activation in exclusively monolingual tasks. In @costa2000cognate, Catalan-Spanish monolingual and bilingual adults were asked to name pictures of common objects in Spanish. In half of the trials, the object labels were cognates in Catalan and Spanish (*sofà*-*sofá*, translations of *sofa*)–whereas in the other half of the trials labels were non-cognates (*taula*-*mesa*, translations of *table*). Bilingual named cognate pictures faster than non-cognate pictures, even after adjusting for the lexical frequency of the items. Spanish monolinguals did not show this effect, as they were unfamiliar with the phonological form of the words in Catalan. These results suggested that, for the bilinguals, Spanish phonology was activated during cognate trials, facilitating the production of the Catalan word-forms.\n\nIn adults, the available evidence in favour of language non-selectivity in the bilingual lexicon is abundant across modalities [@gimeno2021cross; @giezen2016language; @van1998orthographic], and spans multiple languages  [@spivey1999cross; @bobb2020co; @duyck2005translation; @hoshino2008cognate; @marian2003competing; @colome2001lexical; @costa2000cognate; @thierry2007brain; @dunabeitia2009masked; @costa1999lexical]. Modelling efforts have successfully implemented formal accounts of the bilinguals lexicon by incorporating cross-language interactions [e.g., @kroll2010revised; @dijkstra2002architecture; @kroll1994category; @dijkstra2019multilink]. In summary, there is overall consensus around the fact that bilinguals co-activate both languages during word comprehension and production.\n\n### Parallel activation in the developing lexicon\n\nPrevious studies have provided evidence in of language non-selectivity in the initial bilingual lexicon [@bosma2020cognate; @jardak2019labels; @poulin2013lexical; @poulin2017translation; @singh2014one; @von2012language; @von2019impact; @poarch2012cross]. Priming paradigms of word recognition tasks have been instrumental in this line of research. Using one of such paradigms, @von2012language reported evidence of cross-language phonological priming in 21- to 42-months-old children learning German and English. At the beginning of each trial, the authors presented an auditory prime word in English. Then, the auditory target label was presented in German. Finally the target and distractor pictures were presented side-by-side. Participants' looking preference towards the target was recorded, and interpreted as a proxy of target word recognition. The authors manipulated the phonological overlap between the prime and target labels. In some trials, the English prime label and the German target label labels were phonologically related through translation: the prime label did *not* overlap with the target label in English (e.g., *leg*-*Stein* [*stone*]), but its translation in German did [*Bein*]. In the rest of the trials prime and target labels were phonologically unrelated in both languages. The authors found a stronger target picture looking preference in unrelated trials, compared to trials in the priming-through-translation condition. This suggests that participants activated the German translation of the auditory English prime word, and that this interfered with the recognition of the auditory German target word (which shared phonological similarity with the German translation).\n\nPriming studies in which words from both languages are presented during the same experimental session or even within the same trial [e.g., @von2012language; @floccia2020translation; @jardak2019labels; @singh2014one] present a critical methodological pitfall. In these tasks, participants are forced into a bilingual context, in which the overall degree of activation of lexical representations in both languages is artificially increased [@grosjean1997bilingual]. This might have contributed, to some extent, to the strength of the parallel activation reported in these studies. It is  possible that, in the daily life of a considerable proportion of bilingual children, speech input in each language takes place at separate times. If this is the case, the practical relevance of language non-selectivity in vocabulary growth might be smaller than anticipated.\n\nIn summary, the parallel activation hypothesis suggested by @floccia2018introduction to explain the cognateness facilitation effect relies on the language non-selectivity of the early lexicon. But experimental evidence for such language non-selectivity builds on experimental paradigms that may overestimate the amount of co-activation between the two languages, as they put participants in a bilingual context that might forcibly lead to both languages being active.\n\n## The present thesis\n\nThe aim of this thesis is to explore the impact of language non-selectivity on the developing bilingual lexicon, and its potential role in the facilitation effect of lexical similarity during vocabulary growth. In Chapter 2, we put forward an account of bilingual word acquisition, inspired in accumulator models of word language acquisition [@hidaka2013computational; @mcmurray2007defusing; @mollica2017data; @kachergis2022toward]. This model provides a mechanistic explanation for the facilitative effect of lexical similarity reported by @floccia2018introduction. It describes an interplay between the lexical frequency of a word, the child's relative exposure to each language, and cross-language phonological similarity. In this model, bilinguals accumulate experience with words in one language, even when listening to words in the other language. We contrasted this model against vocabulary data from bilinguals, collected using an *ad hoc* online questionnaire inspired in the CDI, adapted to the population of bilinguals learning Catalan and Spanish in the Metropolitan Area of Barcelona (Spain). We modelled the acquisition trajectories of 302 translation equivalents, testing the role of cognateness and its interaction with relative language exposure and lexical frequency with.\n\nThe predictions tested in Chapter 2 rely on the assumption that bilingual infants co-activate translation equivalents in both languages, even in monolingual situations. Although there is evidence in favour of cross-language activation in toddlers, previous studies have relied on experimental paradigms in which participants listen to words from both languages in each trials. This puts participants in a bilingual context in which parallel activation might be result of an overall stronger activation of both languages induced by the experimental task, and not because of regular cascaded activation across languages. In Chapter 3, we capitalise on the implicit naming paradigm by Mani and Plunkett [-@mani2010infant; -@mani2011phonological] to test parallel activation in an exclusively monolingual task. This paradigm consists on a prime word recognition task in which primes are presented in the form of pictures presented in silence. Previous studies have provided strong evidence suggesting that infants at 18 months and older lexicalise name-known pictures presented in silence [@duta2012erp; @styles2015infant; @mani2010infant; @mani2011phonological]. In particular, Mani and Plunkett found that word recognition is influenced by the prior presentation of a picture whose associated label is phonologically related to the target word. By manipulating the cognate status of the label associated to the prime image, we tested parallel activation in bilingual toddlers while avoiding the presentation of words in both languages.\n\n"},"formats":{"upfthesis-pdf":{"identifier":{"display-name":"PDF","target-format":"upfthesis-pdf","base-format":"pdf","extension-name":"upfthesis"},"execute":{"fig-width":5.5,"fig-height":3.5,"fig-format":"pdf","fig-dpi":500,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":true,"echo":false,"output":true,"warning":false,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"pdf","fig-align":"center","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":true,"merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":["../_extensions/gongcastro/upfthesis/logo.png"],"shortcodes":[]},"pandoc":{"pdf-engine":"pdflatex","standalone":true,"variables":{"graphics":true,"tables":true},"default-image-extension":"pdf","to":"pdf","toc":true,"embed-resources":true,"include-in-header":["../_extensions/gongcastro/upfthesis/include-in-header.tex",{"text":"\\usepackage{tipa}\n\\usepackage{booktabs}\n"}],"filters":[],"number-sections":true,"output-file":"01-introduction.pdf"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
